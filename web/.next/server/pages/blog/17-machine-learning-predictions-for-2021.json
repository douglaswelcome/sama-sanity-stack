We partnered with our friends from RE•WORK by asking a range of experts in Machine Learning what they believe will be the next big thing. \n\n\n\nTushar Chugh\n\nMachine Learning Software Engineer, Google\nTushar’s predictions for 2021 are very much based on the outcome of work already underway. The former General Motors trailblazer suggested that he was on the lookout for the following in 2021: 1. The “rapid” training, evaluation and productionization for the large sequence models (such as GPT-3, T5). 2. The research towards developing giant ML models that can cater to multi-model inputs from various tasks and that can generalize well to the new tasks.\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\n\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\nWith over 17 years at Pfizer working in AI, Sean has overseen tasks ranging from quantification of MRIs to multivariate analysis of disease progress and most recently, a global effort in drug safety assessments. When asked what he thought might be on the horizon for this year, Sean suggested “We may train the machine to predict the Machine Learning in 2021.” This rather funny response, if true, could see a move toward the automation in ML we have discussed for some years.\n\n\n\nAlireza Rostamzadeh\n\nData Science & Machine Learning, Apple\nAlireza’s predictions for the year ahead were quite something, and we love the sound of this! “2021 will be the year when we start to see more tangible ML-driven products; from significant improvements in self-driving cars to a wave of new products based on augmented reality”.\n\n\n\nShuo Zhang \n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation\nWorking across NLP, Deep Learning and now ML, Shuo has a range of experience. When asked, Shuo suggested that while the question in itself is extremely broad, “I'd say that less dependence on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large data is a path ML research is heading toward.” A step closer to the infamous automation buzzword.\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\n\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\nJason’s experience has spanned creative positions at Apple, Google and now Facebook, where he is working on a scalable reinforcement learning platform. When we asked Jason what he thought we could see in ML this year, he suggested “I predict that decision making AI will surge in popularity. Imagine an AI system that can tune constants in your code, or one that monitors your diet and suggests food. We have done a lot in the realm of signal processing but decision making continues to be an area with a lot of engineering trial-and-error.”\n\n\n\nSadid Hasan\n\nSenior Director of AI, CVS\n“In 2021, researchers would continue to take a leap in developing complex AI applications related to natural language understanding and generation by leveraging the ongoing advancements in multi-modal (text, speech, image) data fusion-based algorithms and more efficient transformer architectures. In addition, powerful synthetic data generation and augmentation techniques would enhance effective training of machine learning models by alleviating the challenges related to accessing sufficient ground-truth data. We would also see further emphasis on AI model’s ethicality, generalizability, explainability, and reproducibility along with efficient model Ops for a beneficial and robust on-device deployment. Furthermore, with the ongoing proliferation of healthcare data, the AI community would continue to build novel machine learning-based healthcare applications leading to increased AI adoption for providing meaningful decision-making support to end-users.”\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam \n\nData Scientist, Gartner\n“As more and more companies are heading towards AI/ML Maturity and working with more production scale ML/DL deployments, their focus in 2021 will be more on MLOps where they need to work on key aspects of processes like - Model/Data Drift Analysis, Model Interpretability, Data Governance, Model Scaling & AutoML. This year we will finally see many maturity models and practices for ML/DL operations coming up from different vendors and companies which will be very crucial in the long run.”\n\n\n\nBeat Raphael Schaad\n\nSenior Data Scientist, Sky\nThe Senior Data Scientist at Sky when asked his predictions for 2021 stayed very much on the hot topic of COVID. “The goal for 2021 is that Data can support governments beyond counting Covid19 cases and death rates. Given the recent events ML will have to improve massively in inference and causality issues. Forecasting methods using AI do not deliver anything on our historic events scenarios mainly because of the lack of explainability of the generated features.”\n\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri\n\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n2021 will be the Year of MLOps. Many cloud services such as GCP's AI Platform, AWS's Sagemaker have matured over the past years and are readily adaptable by ML teams. In 2021 and beyond Data Scientists would have to work collaboratively with DEs/MLEs to take their beautiful models from lab to production and realize business value.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\n\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\nThe former Senior ML practitioner at UBER, currently makes up part of Professor Chris Ré's Hazy Research group on ML systems in California. Piero suggested that in industry he believes “models will start to come closer instead of being in separate silos like it happens today in most cases. In academia, I believe there will be more research focused on robustness and generalization.”\n\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi \n\nResearch Assistant, University of Florida\n“The year 2020 has significantly changed our lives in many ways.
