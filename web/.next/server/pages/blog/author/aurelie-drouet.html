It's been predicted that 87% of AI projects will never make it into production. Why? We asked ML experts what they believe to be the main reasons that ML projects fail.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nA disconnect between the science and real-world application of the ML solutions and business expectations.\n\nUnreasonable expectations from business hierarchies on both the outcome and cost of many ML projects .\n\nAiming to develop MLOps without due diligence and research into some of the challenges that could be faced along the way .\n\nTo make an ML project successful, we need to find the right problem, use the right data, and develop the right method. Many ML projects do not meet these three requirements.\n\nIt‚Äôs not easy for companies to find enough data to run useful and high quality ML models.\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam\nData Scientist, Gartner\n\n‚ÄúThe biggest reason for project failure is ML processes maturity. There are too many moving and distinct pieces in ML/DL workflows and they are not mostly tied intrinsically by a single tool/framework. Enterprises and open source projects are trying to bridge this gap and I feel in the next 3 years we will see good progress in this area. Open source end-to-end MLOps are very important since they will help with wider adoption just like Tensorflow did for deep learning. Another big issue which increases project failure is that currently data science is evolving and has not reached ‚Äòenterprise ready consensus‚Äô with regards to set practices for different domains.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSparkle R. \nAssociate Director Data Science, Johnson \u0026 Johnson\n\n‚ÄúML projects still fail because of the disconnect between the science and real-world application of the ML solutions and business expectations. We are now in a society that prefers to use the word ML to demonstrate prestige despite having no clear impact. While there are many other reasons that can contribute to a ML project‚Äôs failure, the major factors include: a lack of high-quality data, poorly designed research questions, overly optimistic business expectations and a disconnect between the developers, product owners, data scientist and the ML-based system end users.‚Äù\n\n\n\nRemo Storni\nSenior Software Engineer, Apple\n\n‚ÄúThe biggest reason for ML project failures are unreasonable expectations about what is possible and unreasonable optimism about the project. People have trouble expecting the unexpected. There are a number of ML projects that fail and often these are problems that ML can't easily solve properly right now like conversational AI. There is a much bigger number of problems where ML falls short of expectations or where the project hits unexpected data or engineering problems.‚Äù\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal \nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n\n‚ÄúI think this happens because people don‚Äôt do enough prep work before starting the project. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to apply a deep learning model where a logistic regression can do the trick. So, HOMEWORK before starting the project is very critical for the success of any ML project‚Äù.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\nStaff ML / NLP Research Scientist, Stanford University\n\n\"Because of the uncertainty baked in many parts of the machine learning development process. It is very difficult to assess beforehand if a machine learning project will succeed without analyzing the data, training initial models, evaluating them and then iterating. Product teams still don't know if there's enough signal in the data to begin with, how much data would they need, how expensive annotating it would be, and in many cases they don't have great ways to monitor and evaluate models. All these uncertainty sources, together with wrong expectations, may lead to failure of ML projects.\"\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh\nMachine Learning Lead, Apple\n\n‚ÄúThere are a variety of reasons ML projects fail. Sometimes ML projects are initiated without synergy on expectations, objectives, and success criteria of the project between the business and ML teams. There could be other reasons ranging from lack of expected data, expertise, limitations in the technology itself for certain domains. This is a long-term investment \u0026 hence clear strategy and leadership support are necessary for success.‚Äù\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\n\n‚ÄúMany projects fail because people don't trade off the benefit of success with the consequence of failure. Imagine a smart garage door opener that could open your garage door in anticipation of your arrival. If it opens when you want, it saves a button press. But if it opens when you aren't around, someone can rob your house. Because of this extreme tradeoff, the model needs to be impossibly accurate because it's competing with a button press that is almost 100% accurate‚Äù\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\n\n‚ÄúMost people just tried to find nails with an existing hammer. To make an ML project successful, we need to find the right problem, use the right data, and develop the right method. Many ML projects do not meet these three requirements. There is also miscommunication between the ML scientists and domain experts. It is not easy to find enough data to train the model. New methods need to be developed based only on the problem and available data.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri \nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n\n‚ÄúMost ML projects fail because of a lack of understanding among the Business Executives about how ML models apply to their business. This usually leads to ML teams not solving the right problem for the business and underwhelming results. I have heard about projects that are stuck in research because of unclear problem statements.‚Äù\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\n\n‚ÄúProjects failing in ML, in my opinion, is chiefly due to three reasons: under-specification, over-expectation and clean toy datasets. While most of our datasets are so clean that the models trained on them hardly work in the real conditions, the ones that do are marred by the hype surrounding AI and ML. Underspecification normally comes from a lack of maturity in the field.‚Äù","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-experts-biggest-roadblocks-ml-production"},"tags":[{"_key":"fLUi1ttd","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"1iCuMNwM","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"10 Experts on the Biggest Roadblocks to Bringing ML Models to Production"},{"_createdAt":"2020-12-21T18:21:43Z","author":{"_id":"785c9b8f-1869-4ce3-9eaa-c53945aa9736","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-c187f0a84bc4d1a6870d3a7a8528f242920a33aa-309x343-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Aurelie Drouet leads Product Marketing at Sama.

If you have a passing interest or are just looking for a refresher in all things Machine Learning, we have put together a list of 10 books. Although published at varying points in the development of Deep Learning and Machine Learning, each book offers unique insights. It was near impossible to narrow the list to just ten, but we couldn‚Äôt look past those below.\n\n\n1. Grokking Deep Learning\nAndrew W Trask (2009)\n\nGrokking Deep Learning is suggested to be a perfect place to delve into the subset of Machine Learning, not only describing and explaining APIs and frameworks, but also talking the reader through how they can actually build algorithms from scratch. This hands-on style of writing will help you build an AI capable of beating you in a classic game of Atari and Neural Networks capable of understanding basic images. While this is not a beginners guide, experience with calculus is not required, merely a high school level of mathematical understanding.\n\n2. The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\nAndriy Burkov (2019)\n\nAn all you need to know guide to Machine Learning in just 100 pages, what more could you need? The Director of Data Science at Gartner, Andriy, suggests that you are a mere read of this book away from being ready to build complex AI systems, pass an interview or start your own business. Also available on Kindle, the 2019 release covers gradient descent, cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction and more. Is it for you? Andriy suggests that it is suitable for those both working in the field and those dipping their toe to find out more about the increasingly complex field of Machine Learning.\n\n\n3. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists\nSarah Guido \u0026 Andreas C. Mueller (2016)\n\nAlthough released in 2016, this 400 word bible for Machine Learning gives a great grounding in the basics of ML, providing a thorough and hands-on approach to Python use in ML. Learn not only what the most important concepts and algorithms are, but also when and how to use them. Imperative topics including machine learning workflow: data preprocessing and working with data are covered, as well as training algorithms, evaluating results, and implementing those algorithms into a production-level system\n\n\n4. Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction\nOliver Theobold (2017)\n\nA curveball, maybe, as we realize that those reading this list may have experience in the field, however, Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners walks through ML history and works in plain english with no coding experience necessary. What exactly will you be learning? The very basics including, decision trees, regression analysis, data reduction, k-means and more, giving you a great underlying understanding of the building blocks used in Machine Learning and how they can be used. Finally, some career advice with Oliver talking you through career options and how best to utilize the ML knowledge just picked up post-read.\n\n\n5. Mathematics for Machine Learning\nMarc Peter Deisenroth (2020)\n\nThis textbook puts the normally disparate course style of teaching in Mathematics to shame, combining together all of the fundamental mathematical tools needed to understand machine learning, including linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, optimization, probability and statistics. These concepts are then used to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines, giving a brilliant starting point for those entering the field and those looking for a refresher. Alongside the textual information, this book also includes examples and tests to ensure the reader's understanding.\n\n\n6. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\nChristopher M. Bishop (2007)\n\nChristopher Bishop‚Äôs Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. The first of its kind on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint, uses graphical models to describe probability distributions, which at the time, was not evident in any other ML text. Unlike some of the other inclusions on this list, familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential.\n\n\n7. Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques\nDaphne Koller \u0026 Nir Friedman (2009)\n\nA general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions. This book isn‚Äôt for beginners, nor for the faint of heart as it dives right into probabilistic graphical models in detail, including Bayesian and Markov Networks, inference, and learning from complete / incomplete data. If you want to get the most out of this book, there‚Äôs an option to attend Daphne Koller‚Äôs lectures on Probabilistic Graphical Models at Stanford University, on Coursera. Fun fact, Koller is actually one of the founders of Coursera, an online education platform.\n\n\n8. Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective (Net Developers)\nSergios Theodoridis (2015)\n\nThe book builds carefully from the basic classical methods to the most recent trends of the time, including chapters on pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as short courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models. All of the major techniques you‚Äôll need to know prior to working in the field are covered, including Mean/Least-Squares regression and filtering, Kalman filtering, stochastic approximation and online learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, logistic regression and boosting methods. Alongside all of the theoretical text, this book includes case studies, code to be experimented with and more.\n\n\n9. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\nKevin P. Murphy \u0026 Francis Bach (2012)\n\nKevin describes this text as a comprehensive introduction to machine learning methods that use probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. This overview text combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Alongside this, the software platforms used in examples are freely available online. Unlike some of the other texts in this list, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective is suitable for upper-level undergraduates, giving an ideal introduction to ML and Mathematical formulas.\n\n\n10. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\nAurelien Geron (2019)\n\nIn the last few years, breakthroughs in Deep Learning have boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. Through minimal use of theory and maximum practical examples, this text helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With regular examples throughout, it‚Äôs a great book to not only grasp how and why it all works, but to also test it yourself.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-must-read-machine-learning-books"},"tags":[{"_key":"R9BEAeeH","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"OUl8Z7DG","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"10 Must-Read Machine Learning Books"}],"morePosts":[],"name":"Aur√©lie Drouet","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"aurelie-drouet"}},"pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/author/[slug]","query":{"slug":"aurelie-drouet"},"buildId":"6obM5ETMXaNFf2HCFynGI","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
