To assist top organizations in their efforts to build smarter computer vision algorithms, we’ve rolled out a new release for video and 3D object-tracking in our leading data annotation platform.\n\nThere are a number of applications that use computer vision to track how the world, and the objects in it, change overtime. For a self-driving car to navigate safely, it needs to track other moving objects on the road and make predictions about their future movement, so it can plan its driving path.\n\nAR and VR applications like video games need to track the motion of individual people to create a seamless digital experience. These vision applications have something in common: they all seek to understand the change in position, behavior and characteristics of unique objects over time.\n\nObject tracking annotation offers object tracking capabilities for complex scenarios, including path planning, traffic light status, sentiment analysis, etc.\n\nThis frame-level labeling technology allows unique objects to be dynamically tracked across a video or a sequence of 3D point cloud data from a Lidar sensor. Change in position and pose are captured with annotation shapes like cuboids, polygons and bounding boxes.\n\nSama supports custom label taxonomies for both the main object class (person, car, etc.) and dynamic labeling for other object characteristics that change over time, such as visibility percentage of an object or a specific set of characteristics like emotions. Sama’s built-in automated interpolation between video frames helps ensure efficient, high quality labeled training data for a variety of object tracking use cases.\n\nFor over 10 years, Sama has delivered turnkey, high-quality training data and validation to train the world's leading AI technologies. Video and 3D object tracking are no exception, and this update for video object tracking annotation in 2D RGB video and 3D Lidar data will continue to assist organizations in quickly building models that better reflect real-world behavior.\n\nSama has deep expertise working with training data for object tracking use cases across a variety of industries including autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, retail and e-commerce, communications, media and entertainment, to name just a few.\n\nDownload our solution brief to learn more about our secure training data annotation platform, or contact our team here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"object-tracking-in-samahub-with-frame-level-labeling"},"tags":[{"_key":"OjIX5QKU","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"2ZGxEWq0","label":"Video Annotation","value":"Video Annotation"},{"_key":"iBmdS1VE","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"uZYhm6jx","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"Object Tracking with Frame Level-Labeling"},{"_createdAt":"2020-03-26T16:49:42Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

This technology enables obscuring of sensitive, personally identifying information (PII) in training data.\n\nIn light of new laws like GDPR and CCPA, it’s important for companies building AI and ML technologies to carefully manage data with PII information. Obscuring PII helps Sama and our customers work to protect privacy.\n\nSama’s PII Data Anonymizer helps make more data available to train AI by keeping personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources: People in camera images from retail spaces and public places, street-level images of people and license plates captured by vehicles, smart city applications on public transit and more.\n\nApplications for anonymization range from autonomous transportation, detailed customer demographics, customer data like clothing and emotion, people counters, and security.\n\nThis deep learning pre-annotation technology allows Sama to obscure faces and vehicle license plates that appear in data without the need for any human intervention. That means that private information remains private and is never seen by another person.\n\n\n\nWhen Sama receives customer data, it can be run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs. The service would automatically detect faces and license plates and obscure them, as well as blur faces and license plates so they are not recognizable.\n\nAlternatively, it can replace faces and license plates with realistic computer-generated avatars. This AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm.\n\nUnlike manual blurring, Sama’s PII Data Anonymizer is run without a human examining the data, which contributes to the privacy of PII data. It is built on deep learning and is run within our technology platform, ensuring that customer data never leaves Sama’s secure cloud environment.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Sama securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech. If your goal is to quickly build smarter AI, contact our team to discuss your training data needs.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"keep-it-secret-keep-it-safe-announcing-the-pii-data-anonymizer"},"tags":[{"_key":"4C8kDRnD","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"sCm7cDGc","label":"Security & Trust","value":"Security & Trust"},{"_key":"w6zwqXk4","label":"Anonymization","value":"Anonymization"}],"title":"Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe: Announcing the PII Data Anonymizer"},{"_createdAt":"2020-02-04T22:15:39Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.
