To assist top organizations in their efforts to build smarter computer vision algorithms, we’ve rolled out a new release for video and 3D object-tracking in our leading data annotation platform.\n\nThere are a number of applications that use computer vision to track how the world, and the objects in it, change overtime. For a self-driving car to navigate safely, it needs to track other moving objects on the road and make predictions about their future movement, so it can plan its driving path.\n\nAR and VR applications like video games need to track the motion of individual people to create a seamless digital experience. These vision applications have something in common: they all seek to understand the change in position, behavior and characteristics of unique objects over time.\n\nObject tracking annotation offers object tracking capabilities for complex scenarios, including path planning, traffic light status, sentiment analysis, etc.\n\nThis frame-level labeling technology allows unique objects to be dynamically tracked across a video or a sequence of 3D point cloud data from a Lidar sensor. Change in position and pose are captured with annotation shapes like cuboids, polygons and bounding boxes.\n\nSama supports custom label taxonomies for both the main object class (person, car, etc.) and dynamic labeling for other object characteristics that change over time, such as visibility percentage of an object or a specific set of characteristics like emotions. Sama’s built-in automated interpolation between video frames helps ensure efficient, high quality labeled training data for a variety of object tracking use cases.\n\nFor over 10 years, Sama has delivered turnkey, high-quality training data and validation to train the world's leading AI technologies. Video and 3D object tracking are no exception, and this update for video object tracking annotation in 2D RGB video and 3D Lidar data will continue to assist organizations in quickly building models that better reflect real-world behavior.\n\nSama has deep expertise working with training data for object tracking use cases across a variety of industries including autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, retail and e-commerce, communications, media and entertainment, to name just a few.\n\nDownload our solution brief to learn more about our secure training data annotation platform, or contact our team here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"object-tracking-in-samahub-with-frame-level-labeling"},"tags":[{"_key":"OjIX5QKU","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"2ZGxEWq0","label":"Video Annotation","value":"Video Annotation"},{"_key":"iBmdS1VE","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"uZYhm6jx","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"Object Tracking with Frame Level-Labeling"},{"_createdAt":"2020-03-26T16:49:42Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

This technology enables obscuring of sensitive, personally identifying information (PII) in training data.\n\nIn light of new laws like GDPR and CCPA, it’s important for companies building AI and ML technologies to carefully manage data with PII information. Obscuring PII helps Sama and our customers work to protect privacy.\n\nSama’s PII Data Anonymizer helps make more data available to train AI by keeping personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources: People in camera images from retail spaces and public places, street-level images of people and license plates captured by vehicles, smart city applications on public transit and more.\n\nApplications for anonymization range from autonomous transportation, detailed customer demographics, customer data like clothing and emotion, people counters, and security.\n\nThis deep learning pre-annotation technology allows Sama to obscure faces and vehicle license plates that appear in data without the need for any human intervention. That means that private information remains private and is never seen by another person.\n\n\n\nWhen Sama receives customer data, it can be run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs. The service would automatically detect faces and license plates and obscure them, as well as blur faces and license plates so they are not recognizable.\n\nAlternatively, it can replace faces and license plates with realistic computer-generated avatars. This AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm.\n\nUnlike manual blurring, Sama’s PII Data Anonymizer is run without a human examining the data, which contributes to the privacy of PII data. It is built on deep learning and is run within our technology platform, ensuring that customer data never leaves Sama’s secure cloud environment.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Sama securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech.

And as more organizations develop their own AI and ML programs, the necessity of superior quality data is even more pertinent.\n\nImpact of Biased Data in Computer Vision\n\nAI bias can creep in at any stage of the training data lifecycle, and bias presents itself most commonly in three categories: dataset bias, training bias and algorithmic bias.\n\nDataset bias is as you might expect—the data does not provide enough information for the model to learn the problem, or it’s unrepresentative of reality in some way. Training bias is the result of poor quality or inconsistent data labeling, and lastly, algorithmic bias occurs when the algorithm itself makes poor predictions or produces poor results.\n\nModels trained on biased data not only produce inaccurate algorithms, they also present ethical, legal and safety problems. And in some cases, biased data in computer vision can perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender.\n\nLeft unchecked, algorithms trained on biased data greatly impact the lives of people using the very technologies meant to enhance their everyday experiences.\n\n\n\nCountering Bias in Training Data\n\nCountering bias in training data starts by having an effective training data strategy.\n\nLast year at Embedded Vision Summit, I presented a talk on practical training data strategies to avoid bias, sharing four ways to mitigate unwanted bias in training data. \n\nI want to echo my thoughts here that an effective training data strategy makes for a strong defense against AI bias. Fighting bias in training data means determining your data needs, developing training rules to cover known uses cases, and diversifying data to cover edge cases.\n\nAs your model learns, countering bias means evolving rules and sourcing more data when needed—all while keeping apprised of legal and ethical sourcing considerations.\n\nObtaining Superior Quality Datasets\n\nTop organizations understand that if they want smarter models, they need ethically sourced, quality data (https://www.samasource.com/quality-scale). Your quality requirements might vary, depending on your model, but the fact remains that diverse, high-quality data helps counter AI bias.\n\nFor over a decade, hundreds of organizations, including 25% of the Fortune 50 have relied on Samasource to deliver secure, high-quality training data and model validation for machine learning.\n\nWe’ve helped organizations like Walmart improve their retail item coverage, and others like Vulcan Inc., improve turnaround time to process training datasets. We’ve even partnered with organizations like Cornell Tech to produce an open-source dataset of our own. \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when sourcing superior quality datasets:\n\nBe aware of local privacy and property laws as you collect data.\n\nEnsure you have legal user consent for data capture.\n\nStay informed of the security protocols of facilities processing your training data.\n\nWhen possible, stay informed of the working conditions of the workers labeling your data, and support that pay living wages and benefits.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Samasource securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech, and if your goal is to build smarter AI, contact our team to discuss your training data needs. ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fighting-ai-bias-by-obtaining-high-quality-training-data"},"tags":[{"_key":"JOSMV7ei","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"X1b43vej","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"zoYY0bth","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"8v2jDpFA","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"Fighting AI Bias by Obtaining High-Quality Training Data"},{"_createdAt":"2019-07-11T22:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

Take a look at my related blog post for more details. \n\nAI at the Edge\n\nOn the exhibition floor, the hottest topic was AI at the edge and edge computing. AI at the edge brings AI into small, powerful computer chips located directly in devices, such as phones.\n\nWith the computing happening in the device itself, AI devices no longer need to send data back to the cloud. AI at the edge enables remote and distributed applications, such as using a cell phone to diagnose crop diseases on rural farms.\n\nFor Sama, AI at the edge means new, flexible applications for computer vision that might require new training data strategies and solutions.\n\nHigh quality training data annotation continues to be a high priority need for companies developing AI and computer vision. The challenge remains: high quality data at a reasonable cost and timeline.\n\nBlending highly trained workforces with annotation automation and auto-labeling can make significant gains in efficiency. Sama’s expert, experienced workforce combined with our technology continues to be an offering that is well-positioned to help address these problems with real-world data.\n\nPHOTO: Computer vision in action on the showcase floor recognizes Audrey's face\n\nData Capture\n\nAt the Sama booth, we had many great conversations about data capture. Attendees who stopped by our booth also asked questions about semantic segmentation and smarter video interpolation.\n\nThough computer vision has advanced in many ways, data capture remains a challenge - particularly as algorithms become more sophisticated and require bespoke data sourcing.\n\nThat’s one of the many reasons why Sama plans to expand our data capture offering.\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Wendy Gonzales (left), Audrey Boguchwal and Heather Gadonniew at the Sama booth\n\nData Bias\n\nTowards the end of the two-day event, I presented on training data strategy in the Technical Insights II Track.\n\nIn my presentation, I discussed approaches to training data strategy for avoiding data bias and considering legal and ethical sourcing issues. Data can be biased if it does not represent reality accurately: it is missing examples of use cases, or doesn’t have enough examples of use cases (even if a few are present).\n\nBiased data can result in poor algorithm performance if an algorithm simply doesn’t work as designed. Even worse, biased data can cause problems if say, a facial recognition algorithm identifies the wrong person as a criminal, or an autonomous vehicle algorithm fails to detect the presence of a cyclist.\n\nI also discussed legal and ethical sourcing considerations: knowing regional laws and considering privacy and other gray areas when sourcing data. We’ll update this blog post to link to the video of my presentation when EBS posts it. Also be sure to check out my related blog post for more details.\n\nPHOTO: Audrey mid-sentence while presenting on training data strategy\n\n2019 Women in Vision Reception\n\nWe were invited to attend the first Women in Vision Reception ever held at EBS.

Audrey Boguchwal, Senior Product Manager at Sama shares four practical approaches to training data strategy that can help AI teams avoid the effects of training data bias. \n\n\n\nThe Impact of Biased Data\n\n\nModels trained on biased data can be less accurate, resulting in insufficient training for your algorithm. Recent studies have shown that biased data can result in problems with facial recognition used in identification, surveillance, and law enforcement. Biased data can also perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender. \n\nEnsuring that reality is always represented in your data is a constructive way to minimize the impact of data bias, however, a clear training data strategy to legally and ethically source the data AI requires is fundamental for developing smarter models.\n\n\n\nAvoid Data Bias with a Practical Training Data Strategy\n\nClearly articulate your end training goal and know what data is needed to get to it. When you start with the end goal in mind, you're primed to think through the skill set, tool set and milestones needed to achieve your training goal. For example, for object classifiers, your training data strategy might include preprocessing data to capture bias or offset dataset bias. You recognize that images may look similar before you begin data collection and make a plan to consider transformations i.e. flip or automatically crop images so they vary.\n\nMap out ways bias can enter data and proactively source data to avoid it. Keep in mind that humans are inherently biased, so eliminating all forms of bias is near impossible. Rigorously examine your own biases and the biases of those providing data/information to you.\n\nAvoid selection bias by varying search terms and data sources, and avoid negative set bias by varying data i.e. collect data that contains background scenes in addition to objects of interest. Test before and after training, on a wide range of data. If in the end, you find your model to be of low variance and high bias, use cross-validation to influence the degree of flexibility of your model. Methods like cross dataset generalization can also help determine how reliant your model is on the \"native\" dataset, when compared to other representative datasets.\n\nEnsure data represents reality for your training goal in quantity and diversity, and replenish data often. High-tech, automotive, retail-- there isn't a single industry adopting AI that shows signs of stagnating growth. Refresh data often to stay ahead of trends. Use more than one training set, especially if it's a stock set. Success comes from being iterative, source and label new data as the world changes.\n\nAn effective training data strategy can help you determine ways to mitigate unwanted bias. Audrey Boguchwal, Senior Product Manager at Sama will present \"Practical Approaches to Training Data Strategy: Bias, Legal and Ethical Considerations this year at the 2019 Embedded Vision Summit conference.\n\nAudrey's presentation will expand on the four strategies to avoid training data bias in this post by exploring use-cases that show how unintended bias can creep into datasets, sharing tests to detect dataset bias, and outlining legal and ethical data sourcing considerations.\n\nIf you'll be attending Embedded Vision Summit, stop by booth #621 to discuss your training data needs with the Sama team, or click below to request a demo of our cloud-based data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-training-data-strategies-to-avoid-bias"},"tags":[{"_key":"79xbZuT2","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"hX284VAD","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"VrBfZ9C5","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"4 Training Data Strategies to Avoid Bias"},{"_createdAt":"2018-05-11T16:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.
