Among the 5,000, the average median three-year growth rate soared to 543 percent, and median revenue reached $11.1 million. Together, these companies have added more than 610,000 jobs over the past three years.\n\nAs Scott Omelianuk, editor-in-chief of Inc. put it:\n\n“Building one of the fastest-growing companies in America in any year is a remarkable achievement. Building one in the crisis we’ve lived through is just plain amazing. This kind of accomplishment comes with hard work, smart pivots, great leadership, and the help of a whole lot of people.”\n\nOur CEO Wendy Gonzalez also shared some words about the recognition:\n\n“Last year was incredibly challenging for everyone and this recognition is a testament to our ability to not only endure through tremendous adversity as a team but come out stronger. I am incredibly proud of the work we’ve continued to accomplish, including the impact we’ve had as an industry leader in AI and our commitment to the ethical supply chain.”\n\nWe're thrilled to share the news, and even more excited about continuing our journey in 2021 and beyond with renewed ambitions.\n\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"inc-5000-2021"},"tags":[{"_key":"i2eTixTT","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"}],"title":"Sama Made the Inc. 5000 List (For the Second Year in a Row!)"},{"_createdAt":"2021-05-05T16:24:03Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

Already used to power essential services like surgery, vaccination development and transportation, AI is becoming more accessible every day. That’s why we’re committed to helping the world’s most ambitious AI teams develop the diverse and accurate data sets they need to ensure their algorithms succeed.\n\n\n\nToday, on the heels of our recent inclusion in the 2021 Forbes AI 50 list, we’re proud to announce our honorable mention in Fast Company’s 2021 World Changing Ideas Awards for the AI and Data category alongside leaders such as CNN, Immunai and Zoox. This is Sama’s second consecutive World Changing Ideas win, following our finalist recognition as a result of our animal conservation and anti-poaching work with Vulcan in 2020. \n\n\n\n“There is no question our society and planet are facing deeply troubling times. So, it’s important to recognize organizations that are using their ingenuity, impact, design, scalability, and passion to solve these problems,” says Stephanie Mehta, editor-in-chief of Fast Company. “Our journalists, under the leadership of senior editor Morgan Clendaniel, have discovered some of the most groundbreaking projects that have launched since the start of 2020.”\n\n\n\nThis year’s recognition highlights our AI Bias Detection solution, which was created to detect and combat systemic bias in artificial intelligence. In addition to causing inefficiencies, bias can result in dangerous algorithm outcomes across hiring, safety and criminal justice. Understanding that AI will be critical to societal change moving forward, our AI Bias Detection solution offers advanced analytics and reporting capabilities to spot and correct bias before it’s implemented.\n\n\n\n“It’s an honor to be recognized in Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas this year alongside so many incredible organizations,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “At Sama, we’re dedicated to using AI and training data for good and will continue to leverage our expertise to create the most effective, safe and equitable future of technology possible.”\n\n\n\nNow in its fifth year, the World Changing Ideas Awards honor the businesses, policies, projects, and concepts that are actively engaged and deeply committed to pursuing innovation when it comes to solving health and climate crises, social injustice, or economic inequality. This year, a panel of eminent Fast Company editors and reporters selected winners and finalists from a pool of more than 4,000 entries across transportation, education, food, politics, technology, and more.\n\n\nTo learn more about our recognition and to see the complete list of Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas honorees, click here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"honorable-mention-in-fast-companys-2021-world-changing-ideas-awards"},"tags":[{"_key":"WOaBRJBK","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"JY3FKCos","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"JhqG8b1a","label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"Honorable Mention in Fast CompanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards"},{"_createdAt":"2021-05-03T21:44:34Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

That’s because we know that AI is the key to the future of technology, and without diverse and accurate data sets, the technology will ultimately fail.\n\nThanks to our industry-spanning work with partners such as Walmart, Google and NVIDIA, we are honored to announce our inclusion in the 2021 Forbes AI 50 list alongside leading companies including Duolingo, Samsara and Narrativ. In its third year, the Forbes AI 50 highlights the most promising North American businesses using AI in ways that are fundamental to their operations.\n\nBy combining our expert-human-in-the-loop team with cutting-edge technology, we’ve put in the time and effort to perfect our machine learning-assisted annotation and achieve SLAs well above the industry standard this past year. With new innovations like our AI Bias Detection solution and milestones, including our B Corp Certification, we’ve continued to prioritize our double bottom line, measuring our success not only in terms of revenue but also impact.\n\n\"I’m incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year both in terms of our success providing high-quality data to industry leaders and maintaining our commitment to social impact,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “As AI becomes increasingly essential to operations across industries, we’re excited to have a hand in the future of effective, non-biased AI, and are grateful to be recognized as one of the leading companies in the space.\"\n\nThis recognition from Forbes reflects our continued success in leveraging AI for good.

And unlike human-driven cars, AVs rely solely on their computer vision system and the data used to train them to navigate the world around us.\n\nCurrently, the best self-driving assistance systems incorrectly perceive something in their environment once every tens of thousands of hours. If that object is a traffic light, and the car gets it wrong, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., are all at risk. Here’s a look at the traffic light problem for autonomous cars from three perspectives. \n\n\n\n1. Traffic lights tell road users when to stop and go, but they only work when everyone follows the rules.\n\nTraffic lights are an engineered system, timed around traffic patterns. There are rules in place that tell cars when to stop and go, but the inherent human behavior of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists sometimes means these rules are loosely interpreted.\n\nThere are no physical barriers forcing road users to abide by traffic signals. They work because drivers follow the rules. AVs must also get the rules right, and that means countless hours of real-world exposure to the unspoken rules (or lack thereof) of the road.\n\nThe quality and accuracy of the data received from sensor packages must be precise, leaving no room for interpretation or inconsistencies. Also, license plates, faces or other personal identifying information (PII) may need to be anonymized to protect the privacy of people who might appear in the raw footage. \n\nEnsuring AVs learn the right rules requires unbiased, appropriately labeled and high-quality training data based on a range of driving scenarios.\n\n\n\n2. Traffic lights challenge both the vision system and the team developing the algorithms.\n\nBecause traffic lights are not a distance detection problem, AVs cannot use lidar or radar to navigate traffic signals. They must rely solely on their computer vision system to understand when to stop and go.\n\nThis can be difficult for both the vision system as well as the team developing the algorithm because the visibility of traffic lights may vary based on weather conditions like bright sunlight, rain, snow or fog. Similarly, not all intersections have traffic lights, so if the AV doesn’t detect one, that could be correct.\n\nThe treatment of out of service traffic signals can also vary. One city might use a plastic bag to indicate an out-of-service light while another city, or even county, might use masking tape or some other method to cover broken traffic signals.\n\nContext clues like head nods or hand signals help human drivers manage low visibility or the lack of a traffic light, but since AVs cannot register this supplemental visual information, machine learning and computer vision engineers must train the AV on such scenarios as they arise.\n\n3. Stock datasets aren’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely.\n\nThe volume and diversity of data required for autonomous vehicles is vast, and stock datasets cannot cover all use cases.\n\nDuncan Curtis, Sama VP of Product shares approximately 1,000 to 10,000 images are needed to deploy a solution onto a vehicle, and in order to launch a product publicly, approximately 10,000 to 100,000 images are needed per ADAS feature. That’s a lot of data, and the amount of data needed to account for edge cases like traffic lights in unique road conditions is unknown.\n\nSince AVs often need data from a specific camera or sensor package (because that’s what the car will use in production), generic stock data isn’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely. In addition to this, models need to be refreshed with ongoing training data as road rules, and the world around us changes.\n\nOur team of data labeling experts annotate over 4M tasks per month, and for AV use cases, we’ve achieved 99.5 percent quality SLAs with more than 100 tags per image. We’ve also successfully achieved full productivity within our labeling teams in as little as two to five days.\n\nIf you need ground truth data for your ML model, connect with our team for a virtual consultation and demo of our industry-leading data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-traffic-light-problem-for-autonomous-vehicles"},"tags":[{"_key":"ivLPY6Ly","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"Liw4Inz5","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"3LVFK315","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"YhUSiZyI","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"72HsQzsx","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles"},{"_createdAt":"2019-11-08T19:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

Here are a few things to consider, to strengthen your data security practices.\n\nData Security Best Practices\n\n1. Limit Data Access\n\nLimiting data access based on those who actually need it can help minimize security risks. In addition to things like assigning access based on categories, you can implement infrastructure like a multi-tenant interface to assign roles according to the principle of least privilege.\n\nWe use role based access to ensure client data is only accessed by authorized employees who have a legitimate reason to access the information. For example, data trainers can only perform work, while supervisors can perform work, as well as sampling and QA tasks.\n\n2. Document Your Data Security Policy\n\nA data security policy outlines your organization’s commitment to protect the information you handle, as well as the security measures taken to protect said data.\n\nIf your business operates in or serves residents of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), include details of your data protection responsibilities according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our security and trust webpage features an overview of our data privacy and security policies. You can also download our datasheet to learn more.\n\n\n\n3. Data Encryption In Transit and At Rest\n\nWhen properly encrypted, even compromised data is inaccessible. Our directly managed workforce prepares work in ISO certified delivery centers, using our secure, training data annotation platform. We encrypt client data in transit and at rest, to protect it from unauthorized access from ingestion all the way through to delivery.\n\n4. Conduct Regular Audits\n\nIn addition to limiting data access, encrypting data and following industry-leading data security and privacy practices, consider doing regular audits to help keep your data secure. This could be done on a regular ongoing basis i.e., automated security scanning and pen-testing, in addition to annual or bi-annual checks that take a deeper dive into your infrastructure.\n\n\n\nData privacy and security are fundamental design requirements in our technologies, services, business practices and operations. We use a number of physical and logical security measures, including regular vulnerability testing, to protect client data.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about our annotation platform, download the Solution Brief or request a demo.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"https://www.sama.com/blog/4-things-that-make-a-difference-in-data-security"},"tags":[{"_key":"PJHsWYQd","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"n0lW8qhB","label":"Security \u0026 Trust","value":"Security \u0026 Trust"},{"_key":"hDx5GOGL","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"}],"title":"4 Things That Make a Difference in Data Security"},{"_createdAt":"2019-06-10T20:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

Train a Proof-of-Concept ASAP to Determine Data Needs\n\nThe feedback gained from a proof-of-concept (POC) model provides the necessary insight to estimate how much data is needed to achieve level 4 maturity. Don’t wait until you have the “right” amount of data, or an all-encompassing data content scope.\n\nAllow the results of your POC to drive the need for more data and refine, expand and improve as unknown use cases and edge cases surface.\n\n2. Set Clear Training Data Rules to Cover Edge Cases\n\nEdge cases should not be an afterthought, but rather a key component of your training data strategy. Objects may have many different names e.g., Is it a scooter? Or a small moped? Or, perhaps a mini motorbike?\n\nDefine clear classification rules for subjective and specific objects, and set objective rules to determine their class. These training data rules will help you cover edge cases effectively.\n\n3. Choose Your Training Data Partner Wisely\n\nImpact and sustainability have become increasingly more important corporate values. Consider partnering with a training data supplier that utilizes an ethical supply chain like Sama.\n\nOur directly managed workforce has annotated over one million images on Sama, and we’ve helped partners like General Motors and Volkswagen achieve high-quality data at scale with our training data expertise.\n\nBottom line is your actions have impact. Not only will an ethically minded training data strategy lead to higher quality results, you’ll be making a difference in communities near and far.\n\n4. Test Your Model for Bias\n\nIn addition to lower precision, models trained on biased data can have ethical, legal and safety problems. For example, data biased toward pedestrians with lighter skin may cause the model to identify pedestrians with darker skin less accurately. \n\nYou will almost always have overrepresentation of some elements and underrepresentation of others, and thoughtfully testing your model for bias before, after and throughout production will help move your model to maturity.\n\n\n\n5. Continuously Evolve Your Model\n\nModel training is never done. Every day, the world is changing around you. New cars, new fashions, etc., require newly sourced and labeled training data. According to McKinsey Global Institute 1 out of 3 AI systems require model refresh at least monthly and sometimes daily. In cases where your model is weak, treat the occurrence like a bug that needs to be fixed and continuously evolve your model.\n\nAchieving 100% accuracy can feel a lot like approaching the speed of light, and while 100% accuracy isn’t necessary for all algorithms (like chatbots), level 4 maturity is the goal automotive OEMs are striving for.\n\nKirk’s presentation, “Warp “Driving” Approaching AI’s Speed of Light,” urged attendees to be relentless in seeking out weak scenarios to train with new data.\n\nHis key takeaway was training and validation for machine learning may require different precision thresholds and volumes depending on the stage of maturity.

Unfortunately, many of those articles target expert audiences who already know how to code and design algorithms. What is machine learning, anyway, and where can you turn to get up to speed on the basics?\n\nIn this post, we’ll present a simple overview of machine learning and how it helps computers solve complex problems. Even if you're a complete novice, you'll learn something new from the information below.\n\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\n\nInsider blog TechEmergence compiled a definition of machine learning that aggregates definitions from several leading experts in industry and academia:\n\n“Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.” - TechEmergence\n\nThe key difference between machine learning and traditional programming is that a machine learning algorithm does not have to be told formally how to get from the input data to the output data. The machine learning algorithm is given examples of input and the expected output and it learns the rules itself. As the algorithm is presented with more input examples and their associated expected output, it can improve decision making performance over time.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you played chess against software that was built using machine learning, the software powering your computer opponent would study the results of your moves, its moves and its strategies to become a better player. Eventually, it would learn so much that it would defeat you in every game - even when presented with unfamiliar scenarios it had not seen and analyzed. Even if you're a chess master, the computer will almost certainly learn to play better than you.\n\nYou can apply the chess example to any type of information. For instance, machine learning could help software identify people trespassing on property, predict stock market trends, navigate autonomous vehicles, identify farming pests and more. As long as the software has access to useful data and a reliable algorithm, it can learn.\n\n\n\nThe Three Types of Machine Learning\n\nNot surprisingly, a cutting-edge computer science topic like machine learning can get very complicated. Most machine learning work can be grouped into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n\nSUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nSupervised learning means that software is trained on data that has been labeled. For instance, you might input a 500 images labeled \"cow\" and another 500 images labeled \"human” into the algorithm. After analyzing the images, the program could differentiate between a picture of a human or a cow based on an analysis of the pixels arrangement color and shape. Reasonably accurate computer vision programs require large quantities training images and can make amusing mistakes if inadvertently trained to notice something else -- like grass. \n\n\n\nLabeling data makes it considerably easier for computers to learn. This principle isn't surprising when you think about how you learn. Imagine if someone handed you a page full of numbers with no explanation. You probably wouldn't know what the numbers mean and thus you wouldn’t know how to process that data right away. However, if you were then handed the same page of data with the label “phone numbers,” the numbers suddenly make more sense.\n\nUNSUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nIn unsupervised machine learning, the data used do not have any labels. Without labels, successful machine learning usually requires more data before it can generate useful outputs. The algorithm can try to detect similarities and differences in the input data and start to group them based on those characteristics. With enough examples, the groupings can become very meaningful.\n\nReferring to the scenario above, the phone numbers (assuming they have area codes) would have three digits that vary far less than the following seven. The unsupervised learning algorithm could start to group the phone numbers based on their similar area codes, and correctly assign a newly discovered phone number into the appropriate area code group.\n\nOf course, the algorithm doesn’t even know what an area code is, but it has learned something important about patterns that it can apply to sorting future samples. (And now you perhaps have an inkling of how Netflix can recommend movies based on your previous viewing choices.)\n\nREINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n\nReinforced learning conceptually splits the difference between supervised and unsupervised approaches with a trial-and-error approach. In the chess-playing example, you might have an algorithm that can make any move, and a grader that tells the algorithm whether the player’s move is legal (that is, if it tries to move a pawn six spaces forward, the grader says, “nope!”). Through trial-and-error, the algorithm would eventually learn how each chess piece should move. Similarly, as it plays through more games, it would learn what it means to win or lose, and how to better achieve the wins.\n\nIn fact, just these kinds of techniques allowed the AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero programs to very rapidly become world-class Go players.\n\n\nClean Data is Necessary (But Hard to Get)\n\n\nMachine learning relies on clean data. Without reliable data, software can't learn the right lessons or become better at usefully automating tasks. It might learn from the noise instead of the signal.\n\nUnfortunately, it's difficult for data scientists to provide the most advanced learning algorithms with good, clean data. Some of the reasons include:\n\nInsufficient people to label a mountain of raw data;\n\nIrrelevant data that gets mixed in with desired data;\n\nIncomplete or partially labeled data; and\n\nHuman error in labeling data\n\nThese challenges could mean that your machine learning algorithm uses corrupted training data, which could lead to poor learning results that get repeated and amplified. The software, in other words, doesn't learn the right lessons to do its job well.\n\nWorking with a partner that understands the most effective ways to source and identify clean data will give you an advantage over competitors.

While we do assist in data collection, most of the time clients come to us with data in need of enhancement, annotation, and more.\n\nWhere does the data come from? Well, data collection varies widely, so in this post we’ll look into the most common questions around this topic.\n\nData collection is a systematic strategy for gathering and measuring information from a variety of sources to get an accurate picture about a specific area of interest. The collection of various data points allows your company to answer specific questions, evaluate potential outcomes, and make predictions about future possibilities and trends.\n\nData is powerful. However, it’s not only about having the data, but also about knowing how to capture the right information — and then understanding how to use it effectively.\n\nA decision based on data rather than intuition brings success rates up by as much as 79 percent. But what is data collection, what can you do with it, and what is the potential impact to your business?\n\n\nData Collection: Understanding Why It Matters\n\nSuccessful businesses have always relied on some type of data. Yet the difference between businesses of the past and those of today is that the sheer volume of data available has rapidly expanded. Having more data empowers these leaders to tap into insights that were difficult to harness in the past.\n\nBut why is data collection so important? Here are a few of the major reasons.\n\nData is the backbone of solid decisions. Data arms you with the details required to make results-driven decisions. For example, let’s say that you need to restock inventory. One approach is to restock based on general insights and anecdotal details from sales staff. An even better strategy, however, is to tap into the data, gather insights and truly understand what is in short supply and any future trends that may make an impact.\n\nData assists with solving complex challenges. For example, let’s say that you’re planning an upcoming sales promotion and want to feature a specific product. An educated guess will tell you which product might be a good fit for a specific market segment, but data provides an even better option, one that is more accurate. Using analytics, you could view previous purchasing patterns and determine that preferences are leaning toward an entirely different product; performing this analysis saves you time and money.\n\nData assists with improving processes. Perhaps you want to understand why one department performs better than another. Data can help you dig deeper to get a more accurate picture of what’s going on with each department and the factors at play, and then come up with an effective solution so that other departments perform just as well.\n\n\nWhat Type of Data is Most Important to Collect?\n\nWhen you're trying to understand data collection, it helps to better define the pieces of information that must be gathered. The problem isn’t having enough data; there are vast amounts of data for your company to collect, harvest and use to gain valuable insights to run a more profitable business. So the question is actually what type of data do you want?\n\nFor example, let’s say that you own a retail store and you want to better understand how customers are moving through the store. Viewing the paths that customers take to purchase various products would allow you to more accurately anticipate customers’ needs and place the correct merchandising along those paths. Some companies even leverage data collected via GPS through apps in which customers consent to the collection, and the data is available to learn more about customers’ behaviors and preferences.\n\nOr maybe you want to learn more about online shopping patterns for specific segments. For example, how many products and what types of products do customers look at prior to their final purchases? If so, you might collect data points along the buying journey to glean relevant insights and ultimately improve the customer experience.\n\nUltimately, the first step in deciding what data to collect is determining what you want to learn. Because there is a vast amount of data to collect, you must know which “bread crumbs” to follow; otherwise, you’ll be lost.\n\n\nWhat are the Potential Benefits of Effective Data Collection?\n\nThe results of collecting, analyzing and gaining insights from big data are significant. For companies that use big data, 92 percent of executives report being satisfied with the results and 89 percent rate big data as very or extremely important. In fact, 89 percent of those surveyed in a report conducted by General Electric said that lack of big data adoption creates risk of losing market share.\n\nThe effects of accurately collecting the right data apply to a variety of business areas, such as customer service, which has the potential to create much stronger bonds between the company and the customer. For example, Delta Airlines uses big data to tackle one of the biggest fears of travelers: lost baggage.\n\nThe company checks over 130 million bags each year, and it also became the first airline that allowed customers to track luggage via their mobile devices. The tracking application has been downloaded over 11 million times and uses data to help customers relieve the anxiety that comes with the worry of losing important baggage.\n\nThis is just one example of the positive impact that data collection can have, but there are many more, all of which have the potential to create changes in a business that make customers feel truly known and improve your bottom line. In many cases, the data is already there, so all you must do is seek it out, glean insights from it, and start reaping the rewards.\n\nIf your company needs help with data collection, Sama is here for you.\n\nOur services help our many clients achieve their business goals while also changing the lives of our workers, who earn a living wage and lift themselves out of poverty.\n\nContact Sama today to learn more about our data services.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"what-is-data-collection-and-why-do-you-care"},"tags":[{"_key":"E5C8tuMS","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"nEjDa8yW","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"What is Data Collection and Why Do You Care?"}],"name":"Sama Team","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sama-team"}},"pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/author/[slug]","query":{"slug":"sama-team"},"buildId":"fpyn7Yiasmv-BShm3_n8o","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
