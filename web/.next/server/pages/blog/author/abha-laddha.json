Gold Tasks refer to tasks that have been annotated perfectly.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"Several methods exist to help companies define and measure data quality. To define the correct annotation of given data, you want to start by creating annotation guidelines. On top of proposing a multi-level quality checks system, Sama’s experts have built unique know-how in efficiently designing annotation guidelines that enhance data quality.\n\nCue Gold Tasks; referring to tasks that have been annotated “perfectly” or meet the “gold standard”. Such tasks are often used by the client to communicate their expectations around precision and quality used as examples during training. At Sama, we use Gold Tasks in two more ways: During training, to assess annotators and identify those who are ready to move into production and during production to generate an automated metric on quality.\n\nGold Assessments\n\nEvery project launch at Sama is accompanied with a period of training, where annotators focus on requirements for the specific workflow, familiarizing themselves with the taxonomy, accuracy levels needed, and edge cases. Gold tasks come in as they move from classroom training to practice tasks.\n\nA gold set is created that is representative of the overall complexity of the dataset, ensuring a healthy mix of the edge cases. annotators practice on this set of which we already have “gold” answers. As each task is submitted we are able to compare the annotator answers with the gold task, generating custom metrics and error tags. The metrics are determined by the type of workflow and tool used, for e.g. in a semantic segmentation workflow, we focus on IoU calculations per label and depending on the client rubric each label may be weighed differently.\n\nThese metrics are then used to create trends and analyze each annotator’s performance individually, and provide relevant feedback. We are able to analyze trends at an asset label (which type of images are more difficult than others?), annotator level (which annotator is struggling exactly where?), and the impact of time (was today better than yesterday?).\n\nGold assessments, therefore, help us accelerate training by providing customized feedback to each annotator early on and allowing us to track their improvement over time. This enables Sama to quickly identify doubts, find edge cases, and have high confidence that annotators are ready to move on to production. Lastly, this allows us to calibrate and train the manual QAs on the specifics of this particular workflow, ensuring that nothing is missed.\n\n\nGold Metrics\n\nSimilar to gold assessments, gold metrics compare an annotator’s tasks against a known, completed task. These tasks, however, are interspersed within the production queue with the annotators unaware that these are gold tasks. These tasks then act as tests for the annotators, generating similar metrics as mentioned above. This allows the team to report upon the annotator’s performance against the gold tasks that increase insight into quality and help to further tailor training and coaching.\n\nGold metrics are most useful for clients looking to automate the quality loop on their side. Given that their Sama project team consistently samples and approves only high quality tasks, it is a neat way for them to save time and capacity.\n\nBecause no two AI projects are alike, you need to make sure that your quality assurance (QA) process is designed to meet the unique needs of your particular project.

What are automated quality accelerators and why should we care? Automated quality accelerators are technology innovations that are focused on reducing the amount of manual quality assurance time spent in QA processes. They may be used to expedite annotator education, generate automated measures of annotation quality, and prevent logical fallacies. Our accelerators are integrated into our Sama training data platform and can be customized for unique use cases and needs by our dedicated Customer Success Engineering team.\n\nWhile it’s key to have a human in the loop when creating and verifying training data, automating processes within the workflow improves efficiency while guaranteeing high quality, saving everyone time and money. Quality accelerators also focus the effort of Sama’s annotators towards the most challenging aspect of the task, minimizing the volume of manual rework they need to do, and catching mistakes early in the process —equipping them to do their job well. Ultimately, automated quality accelerators enable us to deliver super high-quality data for complex use cases in the most efficient manner.\n\n\n\nAutomated Quality Accelerators at Sama\n\nAutomated Logic Checks:\n\n\n\nAutomated Logic checks are triggered before a task is submitted on Sama by our annotators. Each task is assessed using a fixed set of rules to check for invalid combinations of labels within a shape, across all shapes, and dependencies with the metadata. These rules are flexible and customized to each workflow, focusing on all errors types that don’t need human judgement. If an error is found, the annotator needs to fix the task before it can be submitted. To help the annotator to fix the task and learn from their mistake, a message is displayed which contains shape specific error tags.\n\nAuto logic checks are optimized for different kinds of errors, including but not limited to:\n\nInvalid answer combinations: Combinations that the ontology prevents, for example more than two wheels being tagged on an item labeled “bicycle.”\n\nUniqueness or preventing repetitions: More than one object in an image being assigned the same unique identifier or the same label when the ontology prohibits that. For example, two noses in a single person keypoints workflow.\n\nSize requirements: Ensuring that size specifications are met. For example, guaranteeing consistent size in a 3D workflow where constant cuboid size is required or enforcing a minimum pixel rule\n\nRelational checks: Given attributes and sub-attributes, ensure that values selected aren’t contradictory. For example, a bicyclist polygon isn’t grouped/attached to a car bounding box\n\nThese checks are incredibly efficient for the following reasons:\n\nCreate an instant feedback loop to prevent logical fallacies, which helps annotators improve and get it right the first time\n\nPrevents errors that may be impossible to detect by a manual QA review processes\n\nReduces time spent by manual QAs and allow them to focus on the more critical errors or sample more tasks\n\nHelps annotators to adapt quickly to changing project instructions, ensuring that new instructions are being followed and are understood correctly\n\nLastly, it improves overall TPT and reduces the time from task creation to delivery\n\nUnder a strictly manual process, highly skilled quality assurance annotators would need to review and provide feedback manually. While the latter process is still a vital part of our human-in-the-loop data annotation, auto logic checks free up their expertise to focus on more subjective errors and edge cases.\n\nOur enterprise-level clients are successfully using Sama Quality Accelerators to realize extremely high data quality for their most complex use cases, improving overall model performance.
