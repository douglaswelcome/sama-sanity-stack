Since Day 1, we’ve been committed to building technology that has a positive impact — across industries, but also across the globe.\n\nThis is no small task, and we’ve been busy since announcing our Series A funding in 2019. \n\nWe have opened offices in Kampala, Uganda, and Montreal, and Samasource became Sama. We were honored to win the 2020 AI Breakthrough Award for Best Image Processing Solution and this year were included in lists such as Forbes AI 50, Inc. 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies, 2021 AITechAward in Machine Learning Platforms category, and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas.\n\n\n\n\nSama became one of the first AI companies to receive B Corp Certification and was recognized on the Best for the World™ 2021 list for BLabs Workers category. Our training and employment programs continue to help individuals lift themselves out of poverty — 56,000 individuals to date — with our 3-year Randomized Control Trial by MIT validating our long-term impact on employment rates and earnings.\n\n\n\n\nUp to now, we’ve annotated over 1B image points on our platform (an average of 1M tasks completed per month) for industry-leading companies by the likes of Google, Walmart, and NVIDIA. And we did all this while achieving up to 99.9% data accuracy for our clients, versus an industry average of 94%.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nWorking with these exceptional clients for over a decade has highlighted an enormous area of opportunity, both for the future of Sama and for the AI industry as a whole. Enterprise AI teams have adopted a growing number of niche tools to support their end-to-end AI development cycle, and a lot of time (and accuracy) is lost building the infrastructure and pipeline required to integrate it all.\n\nAt Sama, we believe there’s an opportunity to bridge this gap, and to do so responsibly.\n\nToday, I’m thrilled to share that we’ve raised $70M of Series B funding to build the first end-to-end AI platform that enables teams to manage the complete AI lifecycle from start to finish.

Thank you to our clients for entrusting us with delivering the high-quality data you need to fuel innovation. And an immense thanks to the Sama team and community for years of hard work, heart, and dedication.\n\nThank you — each and every one of you — for being part of this journey with us.

On the heels of this achievement, I am reminded of Leila Janah, my dear friend and the late founder of Sama.\n\n\n\nLeila’s dream was to conduct an RCT, often referred to as the “gold standard” in research. An RCT is an independent study, in which a third party validates the impact of your social model. We had long known we were creating impact through our own data collection, however, in 2016, we had reached a point where we wanted to have it validated.\n\nThis led to a joint effort with researchers at MIT, and with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), to launch a study from 2017 to 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness of our training and employment programs in creating sustainable pathways out of poverty in Nairobi, Kenya. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive training through Sama (Group 1), or receive training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or receive neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\n(See IPA’s project summary for an easily digestible explanation of the impact evaluation.)\n\nOver the course of the three-year study, individuals reported their employment status, earnings, and the industry they worked in. They also shared insights about their current and future outlook on aspects ranging from community engagement to health to life satisfaction. The main finding of the study is that individuals who were trained by and had the chance to work at Sama (Group 2) were more likely to experience better outcomes than other groups. By the end of the study, average earnings for individuals in Group 2 were almost 40% higher than those in the Control Group, and unemployment rates were 10% lower. Training and the opportunity to work at Sama had an even greater impact on women. Average earnings for women in Group 2 were 60% higher than women in the Control Group.\n\nThe findings reinforce what our internal research has long shown: that our impact hiring model has a positive and meaningful effect on long-term employment rates and earnings. To have MIT validate our model proves that business can be a force for social good. And while it takes conviction to run a purposeful hiring model, we are driving an ethical supply chain that meaningfully improves employment and income outcomes for those with the greatest barriers to work.\n\nIt is my hope that these findings will contribute to larger sustainable development discussions across the public and private sector and in particular will drive corporations who spent trillions each year on their supply chain to utilize impact criteria as part of their decision-making process. Think of the impact we can drive then.\n\nRead the Paper: Evaluating Sama’s Training and Job Programs in Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Atkin (MIT) \nAntoinette Schoar (MIT Sloan) \nKiara Wahnschafft (MIT)\n\nRead More Key Stats from the RCT","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"rct-results-mit"},"tags":[{"_key":"X2bQOmTh","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"RCT Results from MIT: Evaluating the Impact of SamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Training and Job Programs"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-15T20:16:49Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

Our technology has quickly become the preferred option by some of the most sophisticated companies in the world. I know Leila would be proud to see where our company is today and that we are finally sharing Sama, a name we’ve used internally for years, with the world.\n\nIf there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that 2020 was a tumultuous year. From a deadly pandemic to global protests and a national presidential election - its events are sure to impact our society for years and decades to come.\n\nAs many of you know, our founder, Leila Janah, passed away following a battle with epithelioid cancer. Since then, we’ve worked to fulfill her legacy through technological innovation, navigated the challenges of COVID-19, and stepped up to address the ongoing challenges of bias in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite its challenges, 2020 was a year of milestones and achievements for our team. From our recognition on the Inc. 5000 list as one of North America’s fastest-growing private companies to launching our Machine Learning Assisted Annotation, we look back on 2020 with an overall optimism for the future.\n\nSama reflects several business developments we’ve made over the past few years. Starting with our transition to a for-profit business model in 2018, we’ve been focused on scaling our business to continue to provide high-quality training data for ambitious AI for some of the world’s leading brands such as Google, NVIDIA, and Walmart.\n\nSince transitioning our business model, we’ve streamlined our approach to focus on accuracy, consistency, and simplicity, launching solutions like PII Data Anonymizer and Machine Learning Assisted Annotation. These solutions leverage automation in addition to human oversight, allowing efficient yet accurate data annotation and validation to take place. Moving forward, our focus is on further developing our tech as we expand our presence in industries such as retail, biotechnology, and media communications.\n\nWe are excited to share this milestone in our company’s history as we embark on our journey to becoming the world’s leading training data provider. Our new name, in conjunction with our doubled down approach to technology, will guide our company and our mission for years to come.\n\nWithout our community's help, we could not have gotten to where we are today, so thank you to all the Sama employees, investors, and partners for supporting us throughout this transitional journey.\n\nWe can’t wait for you to see what’s next.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"samasource-is-now-sama"},"tags":[{"_key":"GS7wrNs8","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"BSu2iKoe","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"},{"_key":"YLf0JPMd","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"We Are Now Sama: Accurate Data For Ambitious AI"},{"_createdAt":"2020-06-19T20:12:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

This systemic challenge we face requires not only immediate action. It requires a change in the way we think, see, and operate.\n\nTrue change happens with purposeful action and in the decisions we make every day. It takes investment for the long term, even when there is pressure to perform in the short term. As I’ve been telling my teams as we organize to contribute the fight for justice for Black people, “We are in a marathon, not a sprint.”\n\nI also firmly believe that change starts locally. It starts with us as individuals and within our communities.\n\nLastly, change needs to be measurable - not just this quarter or next, but on an ongoing basis. We need to hold ourselves accountable to ensure we’re making positive progress toward a more just, equitable society. Since our founding in 2008, we have treated our impact metrics with the same level of fidelity and reporting as we have our financials. We will apply the same rigor of measure to the Black Lives Matter engagement strategy and actions I’m committing to today.\n\nFollowing our company values, we’ve decided to take action both inside our organization and in partnership with local organizations to drive toward a more equitable society where Black people in America realize the same level of humanity as others.\n\nI’m committing to four core initiatives to support racial inclusion.\n\nFinancial Support: Earlier this week, we launched a corporate matching program to raise donations for three local organizations. Sama seeded this program with funds and is matching each employee donation 2:1. The three local organizations include:\n\nCode2040, a San Francisco based nonprofit activating, connecting, and mobilizing the largest racial equity community in tech to dismantle the structural barriers that prevent Black and Latinx technologists from fully participating in the tech industry.\n\nAI4ALL, an Oakland based non-profit lead by a Sama alum, opens doors to artificial intelligence for underrepresented talent through education and mentorship.\n\nColor Of Change, an Oakland based organization, is the nation’s largest online justice organization. They design campaigns powerful enough to end practices that hold Black people back, and champion solutions that move us all forward.\n\nHoodstock, a Montreal based organization, generates spaces for dialogue and mobilizing initiatives to eliminate systemic inequalities and develop supportive, inclusive, secure and dynamic communities.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: While we have rigorous programs in place to address gender diversity and inclusion, and enjoy a cross-cultural mix of people within our organization, we found that our North American diversity representation could be improved. To achieve this goal, we’re committing to expand our gender diversity and inclusion program to specifically include inclusion metrics for Black and other people of color.\n\nInternal Education: We are committed to hosting internal education and engagement sessions covering topics such as institutional racism, racial bias in AI, diversity hiring best practices, and the importance of voting. We also started an internal forum for our teams to openly exchange ideas for action and provide additional support to each other.\n\nPartnerships: We are engaging with partners within the AI community committed to better understanding and taking action against AI Bias. We’re also engaging with organizations that support upskilling, mentoring, and recruitment to drive economic mobility and inclusion for Black Americans in the tech industry.\n\nMy hope is that everyone in our broader technology community will drive the change needed to make the United States a more equitable and inclusive country. We must stand together and bring humanity to our industry, and to our country.\n\n(In case you missed it, below is our original statement. )\n\nThe murder of George Floyd has reignited an international movement for equality and justice. It sparked a powder keg of emotions that have left many feeling frustrated, helpless, angry, outraged, and sad. We here at Sama stand by one of our core company values -- Humanity. Humanity for the countless number of Black lives who have been victims of police brutality. Humanity for every person that tries to survive daily in a system that routinely oppresses them. Humanity for those who so often do not receive it, all because of the color of their skin.\n\nThe world of tech so often speaks of creating a new, better world -- but we cannot do that if we do not stand for the rights of everyone. Humanity and compassion are necessary. In order to avoid bias in ourselves and the technology we produce, we must consider how daily actions, words, and thoughts contribute to a racist and prejudiced world.\n\nTo quote our late founder Leila Janah, “Don’t underestimate the ripple effect of what you do. These kinds of small actions undertaken in coordination by large numbers of people have toppled empires.” We stand in solidarity with those driving positive change. Here is a list of resources we found helpful.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"our-commitment-to-racial-justice-and-equality"},"tags":[{"_key":"ceQUdDQq","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"Ac6EgzO1","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"s1l8UVKZ","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Underscoring Our Commitment to Racial Justice and Equality"},{"_createdAt":"2020-05-12T16:08:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

As we continue to look for ways to improve the lives of many each day, we’re excited to introduce Chloe, an automated public chatbot service to support in the fight against the coronavirus. We’ve partnered with several leaders in artificial intelligence development including Dialogue Technologies, MILA, Nu Echo, along with support from Google, John Hopkins University and Dataperformers, to enhance this service.\n\nSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, information has constantly been evolving. Most of us don’t have the time or mental capacity to check the news or medical reports on an hourly or daily basis. It’s not because we don’t want to be informed, but it's become nearly impossible to keep up, especially on top of everything we’re dealing with at home and at work.\n\nIt’s affecting the healthcare workers who are at the forefront of this fight and it’s also affecting individuals mental well being and causing anxiety to surge. That’s why we’ve decided to offer our services to help support an online system that will do it for you. Through Chloe, people can get the most up-to-date information instantly.\n\n“COVID-19 is impacting everyone at an alarming rate, that’s why we’re excited to work with such an astonishing group of professionals to help power such a vital service. Our team is honored to have been able to help make this happen.” - Wendy Gonzalez, CEO, Sama\n\nThe Chloe chatbot is available today and supports Canadians by becoming the first phase of getting care - both for your physical and mental wellbeing. Providing current and verified information about COVID-19 with clear answers to specific questions on the subject is the first step. At the end of the assessment, it will provide you resources that correlate with your medical inquiry. But we know that having a clear sense of mind doesn’t stop there. If the assessment indicates that you have a likelihood of having been exposed to the virus, Chloe will answer questions about the testing phase and monitor people in self-isolation to keep track of their condition.\n\nChloe is powered through natural language processing technology (NLP). Our team at Sama makes Chloe smarter by helping her understand the human language. We have real people behind the chatbot, annotating every data asset to help ensure that citizens are getting the most accurate information available in real-time.\n\nWe believe that it’s our obligation to use our industry-leading annotation solutions to help as many people as possible navigate these trying times. Our goal is to provide a safe service with truthful, current and accurate information for everyone. We hope that you’ll sign up and take advantage of this free service. Let’s work together to help alleviate our first responders and support our healthcare system.\n\nWe’re excited to help bring Chloe to market and are eager to contribute what we can in this fight against COVID-19.\n\nTo access Chloe, please visit covid19.dialogue.co.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"chatbot-during-covid-19"},"tags":[{"_key":"k5wnuMl8","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"KjXPtdNx","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"A3zPSdd2","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"z3km6Gbw","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"oNwQIM12","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"Introducing Chloe: A ChatBot to Help You Get Accurate Health Information During COVID-19"},{"_createdAt":"2019-11-19T19:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

Here are 4 reasons e-commerce needs AI to stay ahead.","openGraphImage":null,"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"},"estimatedReadingTime":5,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-9cbf25ce2c598676fd52d23ab3fee8700b305c4a-500x333-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"plaintextBody":"Serving a niche audience, personalization, cultivating strategic partnerships, or even cutting costs in your supply chain to pass on the savings are well-known ways e-commerce enterprises remain competitive.\n\nHowever, in an era where an agile operation is fast becoming the expectation, here are four reasons e-commerce needs artificial intelligence to stay ahead.\n\nImprove Accuracy and Efficiency in Your Supply Chain\n\nDemand planning already uses machine learning to incorporate data and insights like store traffic, weather forecasts and competitor pricing in supply chain operations, but AI can also help improve accuracy and efficiency in your supply chain in other ways. \n\nSince working together, Sama has improved Walmart’s item coverage from 91 percent to 98 percent.\n\nTraining Walmart’s systems meant manually cataloging and evaluating more than 2.5 million items, and while sharpening the supply chain with AI comes with its share of challenges, having a training data partner with a commitment to quality and security helped further Walmart’s machine learning initiatives. \n\n\n\nStreamline Business Operations\n\nAI can play an integral role in streamlining e-commerce operations. For example, Amazon uses artificial intelligence to make adjustments in delivery routes and arrival times.\n\nOther retailers like Gap are also using a combination of human effort and automation (https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18526092/amazon-warehouse-robotics-automation-ai-10-years-away) to perform dynamic product picking in shipping warehouses. \n\nResearch continues on how to fully automate shipping warehouses, but it’s this level of human-in-the-loop AI (https://www.sama.com/samahub-platform)that shows great promise for e-commerce enterprises.\n\nWorking together, humans and machines can find ways to deliver customer orders with efficiency, providing a stark competitive advantage to companies who adopt AI as part of their operational roadmap.\n\nPut Product Recommendations on Autopilot\n\nA product recommendation engine allows you to suggest products uniquely suited for your buyers. Think of this algorithm as the digital substitute for brick and mortar store clerks who guide shoppers to relevant and similar products.\n\nOur work with Walmart contributes to the accuracy of their product recommendations, and we’ve also helped Getty’s Images catalog stock photos based on key attributes, to support the foundation of its recommendation engine.\n\nRecommendation engines help you up-sell, cross-sell and otherwise inspire customers to bundle offers and create custom solutions best suited for their needs, and according to a McKinsey report, Amazon’s AI-powered recommendation engine was responsible for 35 percent (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) of the company's revenue. \n\nIn addition to product recommendations, artificial intelligence can automate post-purchase activities like accurately timed repurchasing messages, so your buyers are their most ready to buy.\n\nCreate Immersive Customer Experiences\n\nToday’s always-connected consumer shops from multiple devices, putting seamless customer experiences at the core of driving customer engagement.\n\nA recent study showed that about two-thirds of shoppers (https://www.emarketer.com/content/two-thirds-of-internet-users-check-phones-in-store-for-product-information-skipping-store-associates) check their phone in-store for product information e.g. looking up product reviews, comparing prices, etc. Whether it’s to send targeted and relevant messaging and ads, or to enable real-world product scanning, e-commerce needs AI, in order to create immersive customer experiences at scale. \n\nWhen we work with companies that want to use AI in e-commerce, we notice a few common barriers in AI adoption, such as a lack of training data strategy, lack of talent and/or platform to get started with AI and a lack of high-quality data to properly train AI algorithms.\n\nIf any of these barriers are stopping you from implementing AI across your organization, we can help. Helping e-commerce enterprises keep up with the demand for personalization, while driving the best level of digital classification, i.e., enabling the maximum/optimal experience for users to describe and see what they are shopping for, is what we do.\n\nContact us (https://www.samasource.com/contact-us) to learn more about accelerating your ML pipeline with high-quality training data from Sama.\n\n\n","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-compelling-reasons-to-use-ai-in-e-commerce"},"tags":[{"_key":"DCGPNa4P","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"KwAtlFPO","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"1uBvx190","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"Cryu3t8R","label":"E-Commerce","value":"E-Commerce"}],"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"}],"morePosts":[],"name":"Wendy Gonzalez","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"wendy-gonzalez"}},"pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/author/[slug]","query":{"slug":"wendy-gonzalez"},"buildId":"YyS8mmepZKXUTIvrtpuNf","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
