So, it’s important to recognize organizations that are using their ingenuity, impact, design, scalability, and passion to solve these problems,” says Stephanie Mehta, editor-in-chief of Fast Company. “Our journalists, under the leadership of senior editor Morgan Clendaniel, have discovered some of the most groundbreaking projects that have launched since the start of 2020.”\n\n\n\nThis year’s recognition highlights our AI Bias Detection solution, which was created to detect and combat systemic bias in artificial intelligence. In addition to causing inefficiencies, bias can result in dangerous algorithm outcomes across hiring, safety and criminal justice. Understanding that AI will be critical to societal change moving forward, our AI Bias Detection solution offers advanced analytics and reporting capabilities to spot and correct bias before it’s implemented.\n\n\n\n“It’s an honor to be recognized in Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas this year alongside so many incredible organizations,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “At Sama, we’re dedicated to using AI and training data for good and will continue to leverage our expertise to create the most effective, safe and equitable future of technology possible.”\n\n\n\nNow in its fifth year, the World Changing Ideas Awards honor the businesses, policies, projects, and concepts that are actively engaged and deeply committed to pursuing innovation when it comes to solving health and climate crises, social injustice, or economic inequality. This year, a panel of eminent Fast Company editors and reporters selected winners and finalists from a pool of more than 4,000 entries across transportation, education, food, politics, technology, and more.\n\n\nTo learn more about our recognition and to see the complete list of Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas honorees, click here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"honorable-mention-in-fast-companys-2021-world-changing-ideas-awards"},"tags":[{"_key":"WOaBRJBK","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"JY3FKCos","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"JhqG8b1a","label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"Honorable Mention in Fast CompanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2021 World-Changing Ideas Awards"},{"_createdAt":"2021-05-03T21:44:34Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

We're honored and excited to share that we've made Inc. Magazine’s Annual List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies, coming in at No. 2952.\n\n“We’re honored to have been recognized by Inc. as one of the fastest-growing private companies in the US,” said Wendy Gonzalez, President and Interim CEO of Sama. “While this year has been challenging in many ways, it has been a year of growth for AI technologies and the high-quality data that powers them. This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication our team has demonstrated throughout the last decade. I’m proud of how far we’ve come and look forward to the advancements that lie ahead.”\n\nNot only have the companies on the 2020 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but the list as a whole shows staggering growth compared with prior lists as well. The 2020 Inc. 5000 achieved an incredible three-year average growth of over 500 percent, and a median rate of 165 percent. The Inc. 5000’s aggregate revenue was $209 billion in 2019, accounting for over 1 million jobs over the past three years.\n\n“The companies on this year’s Inc. 5000 come from nearly every realm of business,” says Inc. editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk. “From health and software to media and hospitality, the 2020 list proves that no matter the sector, incredible growth is based on the foundations of tenacity and opportunism.”\n\nWhat a great way to take stock of business and continue our journey together with renewed ambitions.\n\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"we-made-the-inc.-5000-list"},"tags":[{"_key":"G24pVOQf","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"96XHFEEw","label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"We made the Inc. 5000 list!"},{"_createdAt":"2020-04-23T21:37:48Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

And unlike human-driven cars, AVs rely solely on their computer vision system and the data used to train them to navigate the world around us.\n\nCurrently, the best self-driving assistance systems incorrectly perceive something in their environment once every tens of thousands of hours. If that object is a traffic light, and the car gets it wrong, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., are all at risk. Here’s a look at the traffic light problem for autonomous cars from three perspectives. \n\n\n\n1. Traffic lights tell road users when to stop and go, but they only work when everyone follows the rules.\n\nTraffic lights are an engineered system, timed around traffic patterns. There are rules in place that tell cars when to stop and go, but the inherent human behavior of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists sometimes means these rules are loosely interpreted.\n\nThere are no physical barriers forcing road users to abide by traffic signals. They work because drivers follow the rules. AVs must also get the rules right, and that means countless hours of real-world exposure to the unspoken rules (or lack thereof) of the road.\n\nThe quality and accuracy of the data received from sensor packages must be precise, leaving no room for interpretation or inconsistencies. Also, license plates, faces or other personal identifying information (PII) may need to be anonymized to protect the privacy of people who might appear in the raw footage. \n\nEnsuring AVs learn the right rules requires unbiased, appropriately labeled and high-quality training data based on a range of driving scenarios.\n\n\n\n2. Traffic lights challenge both the vision system and the team developing the algorithms.\n\nBecause traffic lights are not a distance detection problem, AVs cannot use lidar or radar to navigate traffic signals. They must rely solely on their computer vision system to understand when to stop and go.\n\nThis can be difficult for both the vision system as well as the team developing the algorithm because the visibility of traffic lights may vary based on weather conditions like bright sunlight, rain, snow or fog. Similarly, not all intersections have traffic lights, so if the AV doesn’t detect one, that could be correct.\n\nThe treatment of out of service traffic signals can also vary. One city might use a plastic bag to indicate an out-of-service light while another city, or even county, might use masking tape or some other method to cover broken traffic signals.\n\nContext clues like head nods or hand signals help human drivers manage low visibility or the lack of a traffic light, but since AVs cannot register this supplemental visual information, machine learning and computer vision engineers must train the AV on such scenarios as they arise.\n\n3. Stock datasets aren’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely.\n\nThe volume and diversity of data required for autonomous vehicles is vast, and stock datasets cannot cover all use cases.\n\nDuncan Curtis, Sama VP of Product shares approximately 1,000 to 10,000 images are needed to deploy a solution onto a vehicle, and in order to launch a product publicly, approximately 10,000 to 100,000 images are needed per ADAS feature. That’s a lot of data, and the amount of data needed to account for edge cases like traffic lights in unique road conditions is unknown.\n\nSince AVs often need data from a specific camera or sensor package (because that’s what the car will use in production), generic stock data isn’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely. In addition to this, models need to be refreshed with ongoing training data as road rules, and the world around us changes.\n\nOur team of data labeling experts annotate over 4M tasks per month, and for AV use cases, we’ve achieved 99.5 percent quality SLAs with more than 100 tags per image. We’ve also successfully achieved full productivity within our labeling teams in as little as two to five days.\n\nIf you need ground truth data for your ML model, connect with our team for a virtual consultation and demo of our industry-leading data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-traffic-light-problem-for-autonomous-vehicles"},"tags":[{"_key":"ivLPY6Ly","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"Liw4Inz5","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"3LVFK315","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"YhUSiZyI","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"72HsQzsx","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles"},{"_createdAt":"2019-11-08T19:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.
