I'm your host, Sharon L. Hadden, an AI enthusiast and content marketing manager at Sama.\n\nFrédéric Ratle is the Head of Artificial Intelligence at Sama. He brings 15+ years of R&D experience in machine learning, AI, NLP and computer vision to his role at the company. Frédéric holds a PhD in machine learning, has published numerous research papers and has experience bringing products to market across multiple industries, including healthcare, automotive, consumer electronics and retail.\n\n(00:56) Hi Frédéric. Thanks for joining me today. A little bit about my background, I worked at NVIDIA for a number of years, and it was my first intro into machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence. The number one question we were always asked is what's the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence?\n\n(01:21) It's a really good question. Well, machine learning specifically is concerned with algorithms that can efficiently learn from data. For example, building a classifier that can learn to distinguish, let's say lion images from tiger images based on a set of labeled images is a typical machine learning problem, but it's a subset of AI because AI also includes approaches that aren't data-driven, which I refer to as symbolic approaches. For example, rule-based systems or knowledge or ontology based systems.\n\nThose are AI, but they're not specifically machine learning. Knowing this, the distinction has been a little bit blurred. So we tend to call everything AI. Another difference is that AI implies some kind of goal of mimicking human intelligence, while machine learning clearly is in engineering territory and really aimed at building data-driven decision making systems.\n\n(02:18) That's a great way to put it, Frédéric, and where does deep learning fit into the picture of all of this?\n\n(02:26) Right, so deep learning is a part of machine learning. It's a class of models in machine learning so it's also concerned with algorithms that can learn from data. But the difference with other kinds of models is that it's specifically concerned with so-called deep architectures. These are a model that stack multiple layers of representation and that is believed to lead to the model being able to learn more meaningful features as opposed to traditional shallow models like support vector machines, for example.\n\nIt's a field that has existed for a while actually. People have been trying to use deep neural networks since the 80s, I think, but it only started gaining some traction about 10 years ago, mostly because researchers have found mathematical tricks to optimize those models in an end-to-end way. And also thanks to the increasing availability of computational power, so really cloud computing.\n\n(03:26) Anytime I'm doing research around the history of AI, it's remarkable to see how long we've been using it, but have only just arrived at being able to maximize the technology. Let's talk a little bit about AI versus general artificial intelligence.\n\n(03:46) What we describe as a general artificial intelligence, sometimes is also called strong AI. It's the idea that a machine would be able to be trained and then, it would be able to learn any task that a human can learn.\n\nIt's more of an academic notion really, and I believe we're very far from that because we lack a lot of scientific knowledge about many mechanisms that underlie human intelligence and reasoning. The other kind of AI that you mentioned is the one that's been most successful, in my view. And people in academia typically refer to it as narrow AI.\n\nIt's the ability to really, for machines to mimic your very specific cognitive ability that's normally associated with humans, like speech for example, and in a way that is useful to us. This is mostly on the engineering side and most AI work in industry fall into that category. But that being said, a strong versus narrow AI or AI versus general AI, is really more of an academic debate in my view.\n\nThere's an article that was written last year by professor Michael Jordan from Berkeley, which I really liked, where he presented a framework to categorize different kinds of AI work in a way that is meaningful. I really encourage our listeners to take a look at it. It's called, Artificial Intelligence—The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet. The three categories that he outlines, there are first what he calls the human imitative AI, which is mostly an academic field of work where people try to build an intelligence that somewhat resembles that of humans.\n\nThe second category is what he calls intelligence augmentation. And this is really an engineering domain that aims at augmenting human intelligence with things like web search, machine translation, and these are things that that really changed the way we interact with information.\n\nAnd the third category is called intelligent infrastructure. So everything around internet of things, sensors—these are basically systems that capture information about the world and try to make intelligent decisions based on that.\n\n(06:08) That really sounds like a crash course on AI, the way you've described it. I would love to know if you have any just examples of technology that isn't artificial intelligence. I know when you were describing kind of the difference between machine learning and AI, you talked a little bit about rule-based systems and I think often in movies media, AI is depicted as you know, anything smart is AI. Could you just share a few examples of technology that isn't AI? Maybe some things that are even commonly mistaken as AI?\n\n(06:49) Actually, I don't really want to single out a particular field because I think in every field there is room for research and development around something that is AI. I do want to point out that many fields of research and many fields of engineering are now called AI because as you say, the media talks a lot about it.\n\nEven practitioners in those domains are starting to talk about AI, but those domains often have a history of their own and most importantly, they have challenges and goals of their own. If you think, for example, the fields like data mining, like operations research, like control theory, even some parts of statistics for example.\n\nI don't think it's necessarily useful to call them out as AI in that sense because we can easily lose sight of what the goal of those disciplines is. For example, if you look at operations research, its goal really is to solve some very specific optimization problems in business. But if you call it an AI, it kind of blurs the notion of what the goal of that field is.\n\n(07:50)Well, thanks. Thanks for laying that out Frédéric. I'd love to talk more about your work at Sama, specific to our training data annotation platform.\n\n(08:02) Humans are much better than machines at recognizing and judging complex situations and use cases. Sama is a human-in-the-loop labeling platform where our customers can upload their data and receive annotations. We really want to make this platform more intuitive and more helpful to AI practitioners, in terms of tools that are available to slice and dice data sets, for example, to sample data sets for labeling. Because sometimes you have huge videos, but it's not exactly clear if you need to label the whole of it or whether you need to apply some smart way of just picking the frames that are important.\n\nWe support many types of annotation formats within that platform, but there are many features that are in the making, in my team, that will soon make their way into production.\n\n(08:57)Thanks for really pointing out that human-to-machine interaction. I think it often gets lost that humans help train AI. So thanks so much for pointing that out. Of the features that you're working on within the platform, how do you see that technology benefiting our customers at Sama?\n\n(09:21) So things like object detection and image segmentation in computer vision should really be an integral part of a data labeling solution. I think that what's really at the top of our team's list, in terms of priority is better quality in terms of annotation, and better efficiency. So that's really what we're looking to achieve. I believe customers can benefit from even better quality of our in-house labeling and also our ability to take on larger sets of data in a matter that is efficient and scalable. It's about being able to scale and also preserving the quality\n\n(10:06) In terms of limitations around AI—I read so much from McKinsey Global Institute, and I think it was last year, they shared a report of the top five limitations to adopt AI. Two of those common challenges are labeling training data and then obtaining datasets. How can Sama help with this? \n\n(10:28) Of course, Sama as a training data provider can of course help with this aspect, more profoundly, as machine learning and AI gain importance in technology, but also generally in our lives, so will the importance of those data sets and more specifically how those data sets are gathered, if you will.\n\nSo I think that beyond the core labeling services, providing expertise on data acquisition and data labeling not only in technical terms, but also from a social and ethical perspective is really essential and will be increasingly important as society evolves, and also as regulation evolves.\n\n(11:13) Well, in your opinion, Frédéric, how is AI shaping the world around us?\n\n(11:20) Oh wow. That's a really good and open question. I have a few ideas about it. Uh, of course, this is only a subset of all of the ways that I think the world will be shaped. But I think it's shaping the world in many ways and whether those ways are positive or negative are really dependent on how we make use of those advances.\n\nSo first from engineering perspective, I think it's really pushing the boundary of many fields that we thought really were more the realm of humans. For example, if we think of speech recognition, machine translation, and also computer vision, advances in AI have rendered those systems very close to human capability.\n\nWhile maybe 10 or 15 years ago that technology really wasn't there yet, and using these systems really felt still cumbersome. So in that sense, I think it's changing the way we interact with technology and the way we interact with information in general. From a social perspective, I think it's pushing a lot of automation and decision making, in ways that can be both good and bad.\n\nI think it can be very good because machines are much better than humans at making very large scale inferences and taking a lot of factors into account when making that decision leading to, you know, high quality decision systems. It can also be very bad, because if we give too much control to these systems without any human oversight, it can be dangerous. And, the nature of the data used to train these models will ultimately determine its performance.\n\nAlso, if you look at a system that's working in a given context and that's been trained in a given context, it may have unpredictable behavior if we slightly changed the context. So that can be also very dangerous.\n\nAnd finally, I think it's of course changing the dynamics of the job market. And the impact that will have on society is I guess in the realm of politics more than technology, but you know, how do we make the greater number of people benefit from the advances that are provided by AI.\n\n(13:40) Frédéric, 2020 is just around the corner and lots of reports are coming out on the state of AI. Are there any trends that you want to call out that we could expect to see in 2020 regarding AI?\n\n(13:58) There are many exciting fields right now that are progressing very, very quickly in AI, but I'd like to call out three things.\n\nI think in the last one or two years there's been a lot of progress in natural language processing. I think what happened in vision, you know, around 2015, 2016 is happening now in NLP because the accuracy of models is increasing quickly. So I think we can expect some more progress in that area in general.\n\nOf course human communication is not only based on words. I think to reach a really human level of understanding of semantics, we'll have to integrate other modalities like nonverbal communication, visual cues, etc. But there's still room for progress, just based on text.\n\nThe second thing I really find very interesting is causality, so the study of cause and effect between different co-variants and explainability, the ability to explain the why it model is making the prediction it's making will keep growing as a topic of interest. It's actually growing very fast right now, and on another level I think that another area that is a really, really interesting is lower resource machine learning.\n\nSo models that can function with energy constraints or size constraints. Because as we grow more conscious about the energetic and environmental impact with machine learning, there's been a couple of articles recently in various newspapers, so models that require less computing will become more popular.\n\nThis is overall a pretty positive trend I think. Not only because it's more environmentally friendly, but also because I think it puts less of an advantage on very large players in the industry that have an unlimited access to computing power.\n\n(16:01) For sure. So, are we talking at all about AI at the edge?\n\n(16:08) Yeah, we're seeing that a lot. On a lot of devices you can see that you have models that you run on the platform, and I think that's something that will only grow because there will also be more regulations pertaining to data exchange.\n\n(16:24) For sure. For sure. Well, is there anything else that stands out to you regarding the state of AI or any challenges with AI adoption?\n\n(16:34) I think there's a couple of things, but just to call out, two of them, you mentioned earlier the data labeling aspect that is difficult for organizations, but I think it goes deeper than that.\n\nI think even the raw data really is an issue because very often in various organizations, depending on their level of technical savviness, the raw data, if available even is often distributed across different departments and various formats, you know—Excel sheets, SQL databases, etc. So it's very difficult to actually take that data and even just do anything with it. I think that's a very big challenge that organizations really need to tackle.\n\nThe second aspect I wanted to call out is also the increasing debate on the use of data in many applications where massive data is collected from users. I think it's a very welcome debate because we're all aware of that regulation has somewhat been lagging behind in that respect, and it has led to a number of problematic situations. But, I think it will be very interesting to see how will the technologies be impacted by all of the new regulations with respect to data ownership and privacy.\n\n(17:50) It's been incredibly eye opening talking with you today, and I think my last question for you is just, what do you love most about working in AI?\n\n(18:02) Most definitely I think it's the ability to constantly work on new problems, and also the ability to really work with really smart and talented people all the time. I also enjoy really shaping a whole new engineering discipline.

I'm your host, Sharon L. Hadden, an AI enthusiast and content marketing manager at Sama.\n\nProject Manager and Social Intrapreneur, Taylor Rouleau has a passion for social responsibility in business. At Sama, Taylor leads production teams in five delivery centers across three countries. When asked, how did Walmart Labs use AI to improve their retail item coverage from 91 percent to 98 percent, here's what Taylor had to say.\n\n(00:45) Hi Taylor and thanks for joining me today. I know in a recent Medium article, it mentioned how Sama has improved Walmart's item coverage from 91% to 98%, and I'm just curious of what needed to happen from a project management perspective to achieve that.\n\n(01:05) We've been working with the Walmart team for the past few years and taking their retail item coverage from 91 up to 98% has been a really great milestone for us.\n\nThe main tasks that we do for Walmart is to tag items, items in their multimillion item catalog. So they'll give us about 6,000 product types and they update that about every month on average. We look at the items and say, okay, this is X product type. It might be a bike pump or a casual t-shirt.\n\nOur data training agents learn and practice remembering a pretty large portion of that taxonomy so they can refer to it really quickly. One person who does really thoroughly know the taxonomy is our team lead in Nairobi, Johnas Wandera.\n\nHe's been really instrumental in training our team of 63 agents to tag everything quickly and accurately. Honestly, as project manager, I just make sure we have everything we need and clear and good communication with the client, to allow Johnas to do his excellent work with the team on the ground.\n\n(02:09) You know, when you were saying, you know one person who's memorized 6,000 product types, I'm thinking Johnas must have some memory.\n\n(02:21) He really does. But honestly he's been working with it for going on 10ish years now. Back from when we first started with them in 2009, so he's had quite a bit of time and practice to get very familiar with it.\n\n(02:35) I would love to know was that 7% increase a targeted goal or just a sweet side effect? \n\n(02:44) Probably a little bit closer to the later. It really wasn't a stated goal, but the Walmart team has been a really great partner working together with us to deliver that 7% increase. It really makes a difference to have a dedicated platform for project setup, workflow and delivery, and the customized training we've done with our agents makes them something like experts on the whole catalog.\n\n(03:06) It even sounds like collaboration really made all the difference.\n\n(03:11) Yeah, definitely. We work really closely with the Walmart team to make sure their expectations were being met, and the excellent production team that we have as well as our great platform made a huge difference.\n\n(03:11) Well, what was the most important thing you would say you needed to do to deliver those results?\n\n(03:32) I think the most important task as a project manager is making sure we really clearly understand the client's expectations and needs and then making sure those are clearly communicated to the data training team on the ground so that they're able to be successful in their work. So I guess just being a good communicator and liaison is the key.\n\n(03:52) What are some common challenges you face to deliver training data?\n\n(03:58) I guess the most challenging thing that will sometimes happen is that we'll be given image annotation work and the images we end up with when we're doing production are busier or more complicated than what the client gave us for our initial testing and training.\n\nThis can also happen if a client changes instructions. I had a client that originally told us that they didn't want us to tag anything smaller than 20 by 20 pixels in images. So we trained around that and had the agents prepared for that. But once we were heading into production, they realized that wasn't really applicable and they wanted us to tag everything.\n\nWe didn't think it was a really big deal at first, but pretty quickly realized that it meant that instead of three annotations per image, we had closer to nine on average. So every image was taking three times as long as we planned for. Thankfully we were able to do a project change request with that client and get them on the same page about the change in complexity, which allowed it to be successful and everyone was happy in the end.\n\n(05:03) Wow. Well that can be a big change if requirements move away from what was originally scoped.\n\n(05:11) Yup, definitely. Which is why it's so important to have a close partnership and good communication with our clients to make sure we're identifying those changes as they happen and continuing to meet the client's needs and expectations.\n\n(05:25) Well, thanks again for joining me today. I think I just have one more question for you and that's, what do you love most about working in AI?\n\n(05:35) I think the AI world is a lot less scary than lay people tend to think. There's so much growth and change happening in the field, so I'm constantly learning and I have the opportunity to work on new and innovative projects pretty frequently.\n\nThere's also a lot of hubbub and controversy around AI, so it's really a privilege to work for an organization that makes sure we're training data ethically and also has a social mission. Working at Sama allows me the expertise to advocate on behalf of both our impact and our data training best practices and those of our clients as well.\n\n\n\nThis interview is the first installment of a new audio blogging series titled, \"Ask Me Anything,\" where Sama interviews subject matter experts working in artificial intelligence.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-walmart-labs-used-ai-to-improve-retail-item-coverage"},"tags":[{"_key":"pujip4Jo","label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"How Walmart Labs Used AI to Improve Retail Item Coverage"},{"_createdAt":"2019-10-31T19:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

This addition of on-the-go shoe sizing further showcases a pivot across the e-commerce industry toward immersive customer experiences both online and offline.\n\n\n\n3 Benefits of AR in E-commerce\n\nImproved Shopping Experiences\n\nWith AR, e-commerce enterprises have an opportunity to remove online shopping objections like product fit from the equation, resulting in improved shopping experiences for buyers. Online shoe shopping is a prime example, given how shoe sizing can vary from one brand to another.\n\nThe Nike app is said to measure each foot \"within 2 millimeters of accuracy\" and suggest a size based on the style of shoe you’re looking at, which ideally takes the guesswork out of buying shoes online.\n\n\n\nIncreased Buyer Confidence\n\nA general consensus is that Nike shoes run small in most styles, making it difficult for new customers to buy into the brand sight unseen, while making existing advocates think twice about trying new styles from a brand they love. AR provides an avenue for shoppers to find their “perfect fit” whether it’s shoes, clothes, makeup, or even jewelry.\n\nTake Brilliant Earth for example. The company is widely known for its conflict free diamonds, and its mobile user experience for engagement ring shopping includes a virtual try on option powered by AR.\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Brilliant Earth’s AR toolkit in action.\n\n\n\nEven Shopify, a go-to e-commerce platform for established and aspiring brands has made the move to offer AR as a part of their seller toolkit.\n\nThis shows that engaging with shoppers is more than just proactive customer service and two-way conversations—it’s about increasing confidence among buyers by giving them a truer sense of the size, scale and detail of your product.\n\n\n\nHuman-to-Machine Enabled Product Improvements\n\nArguably the most exciting thing about Nike’s AR-enabled app is the potential for human-to-machine collaboration on product improvements.\n\nNike expressed it would be integrating what it learns about customer shoe size as a primary feature for measuring shoes. Over time, this could lead to production improvements based on cumulative measurement data from the app and purchase data from people with similar sized feet.\n\nYes—AR presents an exciting opportunity for the retail industry, but it also marks an era where humans and machines can work together to shape and mold the world around us.\n\nPHOTO: Nike App with AR via The Verge\n\n\n\nIn a time where a 90’s animated series can be turned into an AR-enabled game, and bring people together in droves, artificial intelligence can prove to be a unique competitive advantage.\n\nIn fact, 45 percent of consumers surveyed said they would try AR, and an additional 30 percent reported “they would never go to another clothing store again if AR would allow them to buy the right size clothing with confidence.”\n\nThe market opportunity for AR in e-commerce is promising, however, AI requires a solid foundation of data to be effective, and if that data quality is compromised, so are your algorithms.\n\nAccording to Mckinsey Global Institute, 1 out of 3 use cases for retraining AI systems requires a model refresh at least monthly, and sometimes daily.\n\nNike’s insistence on human-to-machine learning is a signal that continuously refreshed, quality data is needed in order to deliver on the personalized experiences expected of the retail industry.\n\nFor years, Sama has delivered turnkey, high-quality training data and validation to train the world's leading AI technologies.

There’s also a rising demand for vision-guided robotic systems and application-specific computer vision systems, alongside a growing adoption of 3D computer vision.\n\n\n\nA Fundamental Problem with Computer Vision\n\nBhargav Desai, Technical Writer and Instructor at Eduonix shares that deep learning itself is arguably the most fundamental problem with computer vision. The emphasis on its strengths while lacking acknowledgement for apparent weaknesses such as mistaking an overturned school bus for a snowplow is not just a mistake but a revealing mistake.\n\n“It not only shows that deep learning systems can get confused, but that they are challenged in making a fundamental distinction known to all us humans, the distinction between “understanding” the object and “seeing” an object,” Desai explains.\n\nComputer Vision as Part of the Shopping Experience\n\nThere’s a growing demand among consumers for more robust search options including visual and voice search. A recent survey found that over 60% of respondents would be comfortable with new technologies like the ability to search by image as a part of their digital shopping experience.\n\nProjected Market Growth in Computer Vision Solutions\n\nThe market for computer vision solutions is expected to reach over 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2023, which is indicative of the growing pace of research and advancements in computer vision.\n\nThe Growing Application of Computer Vision Systems\n\nEnterprises like DHL are using extended reality experiences like AR to boost accuracy in their business operations. The company is using AR glasses to display picking and placement directions to its operators, and this application of computer vision systems has led to a 15 percent average increase in productivity.\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama quickly trains and validates machine learning, download our solution brief for details on our project set-up and workflows, platform security and annotation tools for computer vision.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"computer-vision-insights-from-around-the-web"},"tags":[{"_key":"gRBnMPo9","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"rxlxYiKX","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"kT5jCNe2","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"3o90fgFc","label":"Computer Vision","value":"Computer Vision"}],"title":"Computer Vision Insights From Around the Web"},{"_createdAt":"2019-08-27T16:55:52Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

Factors like deciding where and how to deploy AI in business and public perception also play a role in the future of AI.\n\n\nChallenges in Artificial Intelligence\n\nThere’s still work to be done before achieving true intelligence. The gap between artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence is wide. AI must first “learn to learn” in order to understand and perform intellectual tasks that can be done by humans. (MIT Technology Review)\n\nAI doesn’t always live up to its expectations. With over 50% of people getting their information on AI from movies and TV or social media, the high expectations of AI don’t live up to the hype surrounding it. (McKinsey Global Institute)\n\nPublic opinion of AI is tentative. Public opinion regarding the trustworthiness of AI is tentative. A recent survey found that 50% of consumers feel “optimistic and informed” about AI, while the other half feel “fearful and uninformed”. (Blumberg Capital)\n\nFalse positives and bias in data cause uncertainty. Datasets are curated based on human logic and values, making it difficult to completely rule out bias in the resulting ML model. (Sama)\n\nShortage of data and lack of infrastructure impede the AI pipeline. More companies are considering AI projects, but few have a process to bring projects to production. Enterprises lack the data and infrastructure to support smooth data flow from ingestion to algorithm, making it difficult to operationalize ML models and intelligence. (IDC)\n\nLabeling datasets is arguably the hardest part of building AI. Among other AI challenges like having a clear strategy to source the data that AI requires, organizations argue that the hardest part of building AI products is data preparation and labeling. (Inside Big Data)\n\nDifficulty explaining why a complex decision was reached. AI is programmed to learn by itself, and sometimes, it reaches decisions that no human can explain. We’ve seen this with Google DeepMind’s AlphaZero algorithm, and initiatives like Explainable AI (https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/01/10/darpa-xai-explainable-artificial-intelligence/)have developed to find answers to this problem. (Intercepting Horizons)\n\nFear that AI will negate the necessity of humans in the workforce. There’s a prevailing fear that AI will take over jobs previously performed by humans. However, AI has its limitations. The Future of Jobs report predicts how the division tasks between human and machine will shift between now and 2022. (World Economic Forum)\n\nGood talent is hard to find. Finding professionals that have the right skillset and experience for AI work is among the top challenges for enterprises who have piloted or embedded AI in their organization. (McKinsey Global Institute)\n\nAs new developments in AI occur, the societal and data challenges surrounding the technology will continue to shift and evolve.

Here's how Vulcan partnered with Sama to use artificial intelligence for wildlife conservation.","openGraphImage":null,"title":"How Vulcan is Using AI for Wildlife Conservation"},"estimatedReadingTime":7,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-72a27932f674f6ebfb6d90744a43bead1069a121-2250x1500-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"plaintextBody":"Vulcan, the Seattle-based organization built by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, has a long history of supporting research and initiatives that make a global impact.\n\nNow the Vulcan Impact team is continuing its commitment to better protect wild plant and animal species and their habitat by using artificial intelligence for wildlife conservation.\n\nDownload Vulcan Case Study.\n\n\n\nThe Challenge\n\n\nAI-enabled products that can record and monitor African wildlife come with their share of challenges. In addition to requiring massive amounts of training data, the diversity of the data must account for species, landscape, cultural relevance and human influence.\n\n\n\n“We ran into a problem when we were trying to detect cows in the imagery. We had a ton of pictures of cows from Washington, where we are, but cows look different in Africa,” Gracie Ermi, Research Software Engineer at Vulcan, pointed out. “Diversity in the dataset has been super challenging.”\n\n\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have proven to be a viable way to capture large amounts of data, however, these aerial surveys result in countless hours of video footage that can make finding value in the data collected challenging.\n\nIf processed by humans alone, the work can prove to be mundane when there’s nothing of interest on the screen for hours on end. This is where machine learning proves useful, and the accuracy of the model depends on the accuracy of the data used to train the algorithm.\n\nTo ensure the highest quality training data, Vulcan partnered with Sama, hiring a dedicated team of data annotators to put bounding boxes around key areas of interest in videos and images, and then pass the data back to Vulcan’s machine learning team to build various ML models.\n\nBen Suidman, a Senior Program Manager at Vulcan, shared, “There was good clear communication about expectations and ease of use of the platform. Often, what looks like a hot stone sitting out in the sun may later turn out to be a termite mound once it’s cooled down.\"\n\n\"We had to provide information about the dataset to Sama, letting them know a set of 2,000 - 10,000 images were collected with certain objects in mind. That’s how we directed them, and ultimately that’s how the system was successfully trained.”\n\nThe Solution\n\nIt was imperative that Vulcan partner with an expert on training data annotation given that any mistakes could lead to inaccuracies in the ML model. The Sama team went through a training period aimed at delivering quality annotation at scale and developing subject matter expertise for Vulcan’s specific use case.\n\n“Once you have a trained team, it pays off because they know what to look for and how to spot certain objects in the imagery. Some objects just blend into the background in images that have been taken from a certain angle from the sky, so you need a trained eye to spot those particular objects,” Suidman said.\n\nTo date, Sama has labeled over 600,000 images for Vulcan, having achieved a quality SLA of 95% in support of their efforts to use AI for wildlife conservation. With Sama’s help, Vulcan is able to expedite the processing of data collected from UAVs, without compromising on quality.\n\nThe Impact\n\nThe Vulcan Impact team’s work to survey wildlife in sub-Saharan Africa is just a small fraction of the work being done for wildlife conservation.\n\nOn any given day, there are multiple projects in flight, all working toward the ultimate goal to protect endangered species and ensure stable and thriving generations of wild animals.\n\nVulcan’s effort to enhance remote identification of animals has the potential to make a huge impact on wildlife conservation, allowing monitoring to be done over a larger area and faster than can be done on foot, or even in vehicles.\n\nDownload Vulcan Case Study.\n\nAdditionally, by automatically detecting visual anomalies with artificial intelligence, Vulcan hopes to enable rapid-response human wildlife conflict and loss of habitat, and potentially use this technology to monitor ecosystems or update censuses of animal species.\n\nVulcan’s efforts could also provide even greater situational awareness to rangers in the parks of Africa and other parts of the world, alerting them in advance of pernicious activities, so they’re better prepared to respond.\n\n“We want to enable and empower agencies to have more confidence in the data that they’re using. If we can lower the uncertainty in the data, we can provide these agencies with higher confidence in the numbers so they can act on them,” Pooja Mathur, Senior Product Manager at Vulcan explained.\n\n\n\n\nVulcan sees the technology they are developing eventually being used for additional use cases, including predictive analytics to forecast how changes in our environment and ecosystem will affect the animals and wildlife around us.\n\nA Word From the Vulcan Impact Team\n\nThe Vulcan impact team credits its success in developing technology products that make a global impact to its collaborative mindset.\n\n\nPawan Nrisimha, Director of Product Management at Vulcan shared, “It’s not about competitive analysis, it’s about partnership analysis. In philanthropy, in tech for good, you are always looking for partnerships.\"\n\n\"It’s about figuring out the puzzle and thinking about, ‘How can I fill in a hole, while somebody else fills in another hole.’ The most important thing is to build key partnerships to work together and not step on each other.”\n\n\nIn working with Sama, Vulcan has significantly improved its turnaround times to process training data, allowing its algorithms to thrive.\n\n\n“Having good data is crucial to any machine learning problem. Working with Sama has been great because not only are we able to get the data in the correct format to train our machine learning algorithms. There’s the added bonus of the impact Sama is making in people’s lives. It creates a win-win all around,” Mathur expressed.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-vulcan-is-using-ai-for-wildlife-conservation"},"tags":[{"_key":"GIh9aQR1","label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"How Vulcan is Using AI for Wildlife Conservation"}],"morePosts":[],"name":"Sharon L.
