She was interviewing me and spoke excitedly about the potential of Sama achieving B Corp certification, one of her main priorities for the company. In the next breath, she talked about dominating the training data industry and catapulting Sama to claim its much-earned spot in the AI landscape.\n\nThis introduction was just the first of many conversations we would later have on the importance of sustainability, impact, and responsible hyper-growth.\n\nI’m deeply humbled and honored to announce that, as of today, Sama is among the first AI companies to receive the prestigious B Corp certification. The achievement comes on the heels of completing our three-year Randomized Control Trial (RCT), which demonstrated the actualized impact of our hybrid model and continued commitment to fusing purpose and profit, both internally and externally.\n\n\n\n“This achievement is the result of years of hard work and dedication from our entire Sama community. By securing B Corp certification and completing our RCT, we’re not only carrying Leila’s passion and commitment to impact, but we’re making a tremendous stride within the AI industry,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “I’d like to extend immense thanks to everyone who played a part in making Leila’s dream a reality.”\n\n\n\nB Corp certification is a measurement certified by B Lab, a non-profit company that measures a company’s social and environmental performance. We received a score of 98.5, excelling in the ‘Workers' and 'Community Impact' criteria, and placing us well above the 80 points necessary to achieve B Corporation status. Of the 3,500+ Certified B Corporations, Sama is the first and only AI company recognized and joins companies such as WeTransfer, Patagonia, Hootsuite, and Ben & Jerry’s, all who use business as a force for good.\n\nThree years ago, Leila kicked off what would become a rigorous journey towards completing a full RCT. This in-depth trial, often referred to as the \"gold standard\" in research, evaluated our training and employment effectiveness towards our mission of creating a sustainable pathway out of poverty. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive either training through Sama (Group 1), training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\nOne of the trial’s main findings is that individuals who are trained and employed by Sama make higher levels of employment and earnings (Group 2). This study and subsequent completion of the RCT further validated the training programs we’ve created at Sama, an impact model that has helped 50,000 people lift themselves out of poverty, increased wages by 4x, and provided over 11,000 hours of training. \n\nBecoming B Corp certified and completing an RCT in tandem is a direct example of how our team at Sama is leveraging AI to address critical societal issues. This year has proved that making a real impact and having a mission-driven business model is what truly matters in driving the bottom line. We believe that receiving B Corp certification should be the new metric companies strive for in today’s day and age. It’s not just about chasing after unicorn status anymore, it’s about creating a successful company while creating meaningful change. \n\nWe’ve accomplished our goals in large part as a result of our supportive community, but it doesn’t stop here. We’re looking forward to continuing our commitment to making a lasting impact on the world and improving the lives of as many as possible.\n\nDue to our hardworking team and our supportive investors, friends and family, we’ve been able to follow through on the vision and legacy created by our founder, Leila Janah.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Sama team, thanks for taking this journey with us.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"we-are-a-b-corp"},"tags":[{"_key":"hZTYAcKb","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"DDJ2bEmS","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"oKWZS5Lg","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"AuzJCOHb","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"From Dreams to Reality: Our Journey to Becoming a Certified B Corporation"},{"_createdAt":"2020-08-26T18:18:07Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

While the initial public perception of AI was “will automation steal my job”, steady progress has seen facets of AI and Machine Learning technology present in our living rooms, cars, phones and more, mostly without people knowing. That said, an important question has emerged: What level of trust can—and should—we place in these AI systems?\n\nIn an age of increasingly complex governmental data privacy requirements, it can be hard to understand not only the level of personal data that’s available, but also how this is protected, both in law (GDPR, Information Privacy law etc.), but also through the development of solution provider products.\n\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) is to be considered any information which could identify a specific individual. Of course, the wide definition of PII can create challenges, especially when searching for AI training data as it can cover anything from IP addresses, imagery, behavioral data, social media information, and more.\n\nWhy do we need such swathes of data? Well, a simple input/output equation suggests that more data equates to the ability for increased training and training environments. This, in turn, leads to models that are often increasingly accurate due to both the level of training and the various training scenarios it has been placed inside [1]. At this stage, it is also important to recognize the differentiation between both structured & unstructured data as well as supervised & unsupervised learning. You can read more on this here.\n\nTo surmise, the main challenges faced by those in need of large data training sets include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nInability to utilize all owned data due to GDPR and CCPA privacy restrictions\n\nLack of anonymized video training data available for use\n\nPreviously used techniques, including pixelation of imagery reducing model performance for video analysis\n\nRequired manual human intervention\n\nRecent developments on our platform aim to address the above through the use of Vector Annotation, Semantic Segmentation, Lidar/3D Annotation, and Dynamic Labelling. These developments when coupled with ISO-certified data centers, vulnerability testing of systems, data storage encryption & GDPR compliance, not only ensure the highest level of internal security, but also the most dynamic and innovative data utilization service available.\n\nMany applications have previously struggled to keep personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources, especially when street-level images, cars, retail places, and similar are discussed, however, Sama uses deep learning pre-annotation technology to anonymize data without the need for a human intervention! The process for this includes:\n\nData is run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs\n\nThis service automatically detects faces and license plates to obscure and does so until unrecognizable\n\nThis AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm\n\nThe above, through the lack of human intervention further accentuates the privacy of PII data\n\nThis service then allows for increased test data at a faster pace, without compromising security, allowing you to scale your AI whilst also not compromising the trust of stakeholders\n\nWant to learn more?

Image recognition technology plays an important role in wildlife conservation and through our work together, we created an AI solution that was able to record and monitor African wildlife and threats of poaching, human-wildlife conflict and loss of habitat. Through that technology, we were able to combat large-scale poaching that contributes to extinction to support a more sustainable ecosystem. To date, we’ve labeled nearly one million images for Vulcan, achieving above industry-standard quality in support of their efforts.\n\n“There seems no better time to recognize organizations that are using their ingenuity, resources, and, in some cases, their scale to tackle society’s biggest problems,” says Stephanie Mehta, editor-in-chief of Fast Company. “Our journalists, under the leadership of senior editor Morgan Clendaniel, have uncovered some of the smartest and most inspiring projects of the year.”\n\nThe World Changing Ideas Awards is one of Fast Company’s major annual awards programs and is focused on social good, seeking to elevate finished products and brave concepts that make the world better. A panel of judges from across sectors choose winners, finalists, and honorable mentions from a pool of 3,000 this year and based their decisions on feasibility and the potential for impact. With a goal of awarding ingenuity and fostering innovation, Fast Company draws attention to ideas with great potential and helps them expand their reach to inspire more people to start working on solving the problems that affect us all.\n\nWe’re thankful to everyone who has made an impact and provided guidance to Sama - our teams, investors, customers and community - this award acknowledges us all.\n\nHead this way to check out the complete list of companies featured in Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas. ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"world-changing-ideas-finalist"},"tags":[{"_key":"ZsUzaThh","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"V1MkPdiw","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"zh1YPgpW","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"3r8B4ITq","label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"Fast Company Names Sama a 2020 World Changing Ideas Finalist in AI and Data"},{"_createdAt":"2020-04-22T23:33:05Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

In addition to spearheading our impact model, she sparked a deep love of nature in the visitors to our East African offices by increasing their exposure to African nature and wildlife. One of her favorite topics to muse about over the past few years was how to calculate the positive climate impacts of hiring and empowering women in East Africa.\n\nOn this 50th anniversary of Earth Day, I want to take the time to remember Leila’s legacy by giving you a glimpse into a few of the sustainability activities we are working on here at Sama. Mid last year, we officially launched our sustainability program. Our first goals were to understand our carbon footprint (GHGe per GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, Scope 1 and 2), develop an environmentally preferable purchasing program for ongoing consumables, and create biophilic office environments that brought nature inside.\n\nPHOTO: Sama East Africa delivery center\n\n\n\nUltimately, Leila wanted to pursue B Corporation certification. She always wanted to lead by example, to show the world how business could be both profitable and a force for good.\n\nWhat better way to do this than provide the ultimate success story and demonstrate that a technology company can be committed to both providing the leading training data platform and to using business as a force for good?\n\n“One of the things I’m proudest of at Sama is our collaboration with conservation groups including the Nature Conservancy to use AI to track endangered species, combat poaching, and protect wilderness. Not only that, but we do it by employing women (more than 50% of our workforce!) from low-income backgrounds, which itself is a way to fight climate change.” - Leila Janah\n\n\n\nI’m thrilled that Sama is actively engaged with B Lab and is in the final stages of audit verification for our B Corporation certification. I couldn’t be prouder of our Nairobi based Sustainability Analyst, Robert Wahome, for ensuring we have all of the data in place needed to drive this initiative forward, including our first ever Carbon Footprint. In my heart, I know Leila is proud too.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"celebrating-50-years-of-earth-day-honoring-leila-janahs-legacy"},"tags":[{"_key":"OFjdWc6T","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"OtSjlWNo","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"fWAUAQ8u","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Celebrating 50 Years of Earth Day: Honoring Leila Janah's Legacy"},{"_createdAt":"2020-03-08T19:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

I’m grateful that everyday I get to witness history in the making as part of a female-led tech company that provides industry leading, high quality training data technology and solutions that are underpinned by an ethical AI supply chain.\n\nIt’s this commitment to an ethical supply chain that enables us to close the gender pay gap by paying a living wage to all of our employees.\n\nThe AI supply chain is the combination of the human workforce and advanced technology solutions that help bring machine learning based systems to market. To operationalize AI, everything from data labeling to model development needs to be in sync, and as it is with any supply chain, ethics and sustainability come into play. \n\nBehind every Al, there’s a person deciding what data is needed and the best model to use. There’s also someone guiding AI strategy, developing the tech to support AI pipelines, and so on.\n\nData annotation is a key part of making machine learning possible, and conversations around ethical AI supply chains are vital to have now if we want to ensure the labeling industry is a positive force.\n\nAccording to our baseline impact survey data, prior to joining Sama, female workers in our global delivery centers earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, despite having comparable educational backgrounds.\n\nWe found that gender discrimination—especially in the technology sector—and the challenge of being a primary family caretaker make it difficult for many women to get into and stay in the formal employment sector in Kenya and Uganda.\n\nWomen are highly driven and eager to align their education with real-world opportunities, yet a recent report from the World Economic Forum found that if progress continues at its current rate, it would take roughly 95 years for sub-Saharan Africa to achieve gender parity.\n\nThis number is astonishing, but there is a path forward, and it involves equipping younger generations with the skills needed to succeed in the growing digital economy.\n\nAt Sama, our workers receive digital literacy training, as well as specialized training on artificial intelligence and our advanced training data platform. Also, in addition to connecting women and youth to dignified digital work, workers gain access to life and professional skills development opportunities, to further advance their careers.\n\nWhen women succeed, everyone benefits, and closing the gender gap at work is key to achieving at least five of the sustainable development goals set by the UN. In the last decade, Sama has positively impacted over 50,000 lives, and we’re proud to have achieved gender parity in our global work centers, by ensuring our workers earn equal pay for equal work. \n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about our impact, read our story here, or work with us on training data and model validation, to start making a positive global impact one bounding box at a time.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-samasource-is-closing-the-gender-pay-gap-for-women-in-the-ai-supply-chain"},"tags":[{"_key":"daz4fDnC","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"wLYQCPhS","label":"Women in AI","value":"Women in AI"},{"_key":"EiPsNBnG","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"How Sama is Closing the Gender Pay Gap for Women in the AI Supply Chain"},{"_createdAt":"2019-07-01T21:45:00Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

Julius is a former Sama employee that now employs over 25 people in the business he started with Sama GiveWork Challenge funds.\n\n\n\nIf you’re not familiar, Sama provides training data and algorithm validation to 25 percent of the Fortune 50. While our headquarters is in San Francisco, we’re one of the largest AI providers, and one of the largest digital employers, in East Africa.\n\nBefore joining Sama, I knew AI had a human element - that the algorithms we train couldn’t exist without humans.\n\nAfter all, every marketing slick touts how the combination of human and machine intelligence will make us smarter, more efficient -- superhuman.\n\nWhat we’re not told is that behind every machine learning algorithm, there’s a band of people tasked with labeling the data used to train AI technologies.\n\nFor example, a self-driving car gets its initial smarts from a human reviewing thousands of images and/or video and labeling the cars, trucks, sidewalks, pedestrians, etc., that are present. This is how the car learns to be autonomous.\n\nThese humans creating training data for algorithms are the soul of AI.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a deep focus in measuring and managing environmental and social impacts of supply chains and implementing corporate impact programs. Carbon footprint and circular economy were part of my everyday lexicon.\n\nNow, staring into the eyes of our human workforce -- the real-life AI supply chain -- I started to think of the implications for supply chain ethics and sustainability. And, I realized how serendipitous it was to be working at an organization that embraced paying a living wage and equally distributing opportunity from the start, thanks to the vision of our founder Leila Janah.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-ai-supply-chain-protecting-the-soul-of-ai"},"tags":[{"_key":"5qTQ6zwl","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"iRBewe3m","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"29LDhGI9","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"TkUkSBfs","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"The Ethical AI Supply Chain: Protecting the Soul of AI"},{"_createdAt":"2019-06-28T21:59:52Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.
