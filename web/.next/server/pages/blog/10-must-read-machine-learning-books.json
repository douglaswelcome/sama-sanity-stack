If you want to get the most out of this book, there’s an option to attend Daphne Koller’s lectures on Probabilistic Graphical Models at Stanford University, on Coursera. Fun fact, Koller is actually one of the founders of Coursera, an online education platform.\n\n\n8. Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective (Net Developers)\nSergios Theodoridis (2015)\n\nThe book builds carefully from the basic classical methods to the most recent trends of the time, including chapters on pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as short courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models. All of the major techniques you’ll need to know prior to working in the field are covered, including Mean/Least-Squares regression and filtering, Kalman filtering, stochastic approximation and online learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, logistic regression and boosting methods. Alongside all of the theoretical text, this book includes case studies, code to be experimented with and more.\n\n\n9. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\nKevin P. Murphy & Francis Bach (2012)\n\nKevin describes this text as a comprehensive introduction to machine learning methods that use probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. This overview text combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Alongside this, the software platforms used in examples are freely available online. Unlike some of the other texts in this list, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective is suitable for upper-level undergraduates, giving an ideal introduction to ML and Mathematical formulas.\n\n\n10. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\nAurelien Geron (2019)\n\nIn the last few years, breakthroughs in Deep Learning have boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. Through minimal use of theory and maximum practical examples, this text helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With regular examples throughout, it’s a great book to not only grasp how and why it all works, but to also test it yourself.","relatedPosts":[{"_id":"edd6abc4-87b4-42db-a32a-15900a353dbf","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-30d0eaccd1e57322b31a4e16b84576ef1f8db57e-1920x960-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"zerog-aircraft-turnaround"},"tags":[{"label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management"},{"_id":"4d9c5816-3584-4622-8ea6-77869ca8dbf0","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f80b5e83a9927bafc61285d9e7a16b07070f53c1-1200x630-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sama-mila-partnership"},"tags":[{"_key":"ZLub2KFj","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"}],"title":"Sama Partners with Mila to Solve Key Problems in AI Development"},{"_id":"728400d2-d453-42f7-b20c-47f753bc4583","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-1502043edcf701cb4267cb2f6d7c6edf8e0e0cad-2500x1313-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"podcast-episode-facebook-manohar-paluri"},"tags":[{"_key":"6BgUw5oN","label":"Podcast","value":"Podcast"}],"title":"New Podcast Episode: Facebook's Manohar Paluri Makes Machines See"}],"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-must-read-machine-learning-books"},"tags":[{"_key":"R9BEAeeH","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"OUl8Z7DG","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"10 Must-Read Machine Learning Books"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
