For example, Amazon uses artificial intelligence to make adjustments in delivery routes and arrival times.\n\nOther retailers like Gap are also using a combination of human effort and automation (https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18526092/amazon-warehouse-robotics-automation-ai-10-years-away) to perform dynamic product picking in shipping warehouses. \n\nResearch continues on how to fully automate shipping warehouses, but it’s this level of human-in-the-loop AI (https://www.sama.com/samahub-platform)that shows great promise for e-commerce enterprises.\n\nWorking together, humans and machines can find ways to deliver customer orders with efficiency, providing a stark competitive advantage to companies who adopt AI as part of their operational roadmap.\n\nPut Product Recommendations on Autopilot\n\nA product recommendation engine allows you to suggest products uniquely suited for your buyers. Think of this algorithm as the digital substitute for brick and mortar store clerks who guide shoppers to relevant and similar products.\n\nOur work with Walmart contributes to the accuracy of their product recommendations, and we’ve also helped Getty’s Images catalog stock photos based on key attributes, to support the foundation of its recommendation engine.\n\nRecommendation engines help you up-sell, cross-sell and otherwise inspire customers to bundle offers and create custom solutions best suited for their needs, and according to a McKinsey report, Amazon’s AI-powered recommendation engine was responsible for 35 percent (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) of the company's revenue. \n\nIn addition to product recommendations, artificial intelligence can automate post-purchase activities like accurately timed repurchasing messages, so your buyers are their most ready to buy.\n\nCreate Immersive Customer Experiences\n\nToday’s always-connected consumer shops from multiple devices, putting seamless customer experiences at the core of driving customer engagement.\n\nA recent study showed that about two-thirds of shoppers (https://www.emarketer.com/content/two-thirds-of-internet-users-check-phones-in-store-for-product-information-skipping-store-associates) check their phone in-store for product information e.g. looking up product reviews, comparing prices, etc. Whether it’s to send targeted and relevant messaging and ads, or to enable real-world product scanning, e-commerce needs AI, in order to create immersive customer experiences at scale. \n\nWhen we work with companies that want to use AI in e-commerce, we notice a few common barriers in AI adoption, such as a lack of training data strategy, lack of talent and/or platform to get started with AI and a lack of high-quality data to properly train AI algorithms.\n\nIf any of these barriers are stopping you from implementing AI across your organization, we can help. Helping e-commerce enterprises keep up with the demand for personalization, while driving the best level of digital classification, i.e., enabling the maximum/optimal experience for users to describe and see what they are shopping for, is what we do.\n\nContact us (https://www.samasource.com/contact-us) to learn more about accelerating your ML pipeline with high-quality training data from Sama.\n\n\n","relatedPosts":[{"_id":"edd6abc4-87b4-42db-a32a-15900a353dbf","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-30d0eaccd1e57322b31a4e16b84576ef1f8db57e-1920x960-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"zerog-aircraft-turnaround"},"tags":[{"label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management"},{"_id":"4d9c5816-3584-4622-8ea6-77869ca8dbf0","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f80b5e83a9927bafc61285d9e7a16b07070f53c1-1200x630-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sama-mila-partnership"},"tags":[{"_key":"ZLub2KFj","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"}],"title":"Sama Partners with Mila to Solve Key Problems in AI Development"},{"_id":"728400d2-d453-42f7-b20c-47f753bc4583","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-1502043edcf701cb4267cb2f6d7c6edf8e0e0cad-2500x1313-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"podcast-episode-facebook-manohar-paluri"},"tags":[{"_key":"6BgUw5oN","label":"Podcast","value":"Podcast"}],"title":"New Podcast Episode: Facebook's Manohar Paluri Makes Machines See"}],"seo_title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-compelling-reasons-to-use-ai-in-e-commerce"},"tags":[{"_key":"DCGPNa4P","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"KwAtlFPO","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"1uBvx190","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"Cryu3t8R","label":"E-Commerce","value":"E-Commerce"}],"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"},"config":{"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce","description":"When we work with companies that want to use AI in e-commerce, we notice a few common barriers in AI adoption.
