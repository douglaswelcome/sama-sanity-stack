As home base of many of the world’s largest car manufacturers, Japan showcases world-leading technology to accelerate the development of self-driving cars.\n\nThere’s a great line up of over 160 interesting speakers. Some of the speeches we look forward to attend, include Osama Itoh (Honda) on predicting performance of pedestrian protection and Hiroaki Mikami (Sony) on Distributed DNN Training with Adaptive Batch-size Control. Next to that, it will be great to visit Ryuji Hamamoto on Analysing medical data applying AI to diagnosis and treatment. And without a doubt, with the advancements in our proprietary technology platform, we look forward to hear from Yukiko Yanagawa (Omron) speaking about Object type recognition by 3D point cloud LiDAR data.\n\nMeet our VP Sales Houk Nolten or Business Development Director Dennis van Herk, or register to set a time upfront to meet our training data experts during the conference.\n\n\n\n3. AUTOSENS BRUSSELS\n\n\nCalled the leading technical summit for ADAS and autonomous vehicle perception technology, AutoSens is the place to be for engineers that go beyond the hype. From 17-20 September, Brussels will be visited by over 500 senior technical experts from the automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers, offering insightful technical presentations focused around the vehicle perception process chain.\n\nLike Robert Stead, Conference Director of Autosens said, ‘I decided to start this event, because I saw a need to through the hype and create a meeting that is truly for the engineers - the guys and girls who are applying their knowledge and solving engineering problems on a daily basis. Autosens is a technical conference, but set in the business context of a complex supply chain. By assembling a representative advisory board, we can get to the heart of the challenges facing the army of engineers crunching the numbers and running the trials that move ideas from the drawing board into production vehicles.’\n\nMeet our Business Development Director Dennis van Herk or Celie Jenkins or get in touch with our Director Advisory Services Mélodie Kinet, or register to set a time upfront to meet our training data experts during the conference.\n\n\n\n4. AI SUMMIT SAN FRANCISCO\n\n\nNow in its 3rd year, The AI Summit is the world’s first and largest conference & exhibition to look at the practical implications of AI for enterprise organizations, the actual solutions that are transforming business productivity. The AI Summit aims to help the business leader, data scientist and engineer successfully implement their AI projects.\n\nWe previously attended the AI Summit in London earlier this year, and will be attending again in San Francisco, September 19 - 20. It will be held at the beautiful Palace of Fine Arts, with over 200 speakers and exhibitors. Make sure to catch our team there at booth 908 to talk training data and all of its applications!\n\n\n\n5. AUTO AI BERLIN\n\n\nWe.Connect hosts Europe’s number 1 event on deep driving & Level +5 automation in Berlin, September 23 – September 25. The event brings together the ADAS scene with all stakeholders who play an active role in the deep driving, imaging, computer vision, sensor fusion and perception and Level +5 automation. The 2-day program provides extensive learning and networking at the Maritim proArte Hotel Berlin.\n\nThe event’s mission is to be an active part of the full automation and self-driving cars reality. You’ll explore how AI, ML & CV will change technology concepts, architectures, software platforms, ADAS, and further technical requirements. Discuss the challenges of AI supported, cognitive cars, discover latest trends in sensor and perception technology and cover the full scope of deep driving in Level 4 & Level 5 from market leaders.\n\nMake sure not to miss the icebreaker on Sunday, September 23, and Auto.AI Evening Dinner to network with peers. Let’s meet at one of the events or come to visit us at our booth no.2.\n\n\n\n6. GTC EUROPE\n\n\n‘Over three thousand attendees, more than 200 speaking sessions and over 80 exhibitors with brilliant demos’, those are among the top reasons you can’t afford to miss GTC Europe 2018 according to NVIDIA. The premier AI Conference, October 9 – 11 in Munich, is the place to discover how deep learning is taking part of NVIDIA’s offerings, meet great people from all over the world and learn from breakthrough work in the fields of artificial intelligence, deep learning, virtual reality, high performance computing, autonomous machines and much more.\n\nThe event host speakers from many of our clients, including NVIDIA, Google and Facebook, as well as many others from the automotive car manufacturing and mapping companies, hightech and ecommerce scene. Like to learn more from 10 years of best practices in training the AI models of companies alike? Meet us at our booth E13 near the Nvidia Square.\n\n\n\n7. WORLD AI\n\n\nAfter a great success last year, Amsterdam will host another World Summit AI at October 10 - 11 for the entire AI ecosystem from Enterprise to Big Tech, Startups, Investors and Science. Doubling the size of the summit expecting 6.000 attendees and over 140 of the brightest brains on stage, the event will tackle burning AI issues for 2018 and beyond. Particularly interesting are the applied solutions for enterprises as well as discussions on AI ethics and AI4good.\n\nWith the Netherlands being Sama stepping stone to Europe last year to train the eyes of self-driving cars, robotics and e-commerce platforms to enhance visual search, we didn’t want to close the list without mentioning the great Dutch AI events. Interested to learn from our best practices to train AI? We’d like to welcome you at our European Head Office in the WTC in the Hague!","relatedPosts":[{"_id":"edd6abc4-87b4-42db-a32a-15900a353dbf","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-30d0eaccd1e57322b31a4e16b84576ef1f8db57e-1920x960-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"zerog-aircraft-turnaround"},"tags":[{"label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management"},{"_id":"4d9c5816-3584-4622-8ea6-77869ca8dbf0","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f80b5e83a9927bafc61285d9e7a16b07070f53c1-1200x630-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sama-mila-partnership"},"tags":[{"_key":"ZLub2KFj","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"}],"title":"Sama Partners with Mila to Solve Key Problems in AI Development"},{"_id":"728400d2-d453-42f7-b20c-47f753bc4583","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-1502043edcf701cb4267cb2f6d7c6edf8e0e0cad-2500x1313-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"podcast-episode-facebook-manohar-paluri"},"tags":[{"_key":"6BgUw5oN","label":"Podcast","value":"Podcast"}],"title":"New Podcast Episode: Facebook's Manohar Paluri Makes Machines See"}],"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"coming-ai-events-to-attend-september-october-2018"},"tags":[{"_key":"t34DnXsa","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"m7M7ftb0","label":"Events","value":"Events"}],"title":"AI Events to Attend in Fall of 2018"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
