The videos captured a wide variety of objects – some moving, some stationary: aircraft types, water trucks, catering trucks, employees, safety pylons, foreign object debris that could potentially get sucked into the engine.\n\nSource.\n\nzeroG needed high-precision polygon and key point labels for their multi-layered processes, with little to no margin of error. To deliver the highest possible quality data, they partnered with Sama to annotate their datasets.\n\n\nHow Sama helped zeroG deliver quality datasets at scale\n\n\n\nWhen zeroG set out to push the limits of what is possible with highly accurate turnaround data, they could not compromise on any aspect of their project. They worked with extremely high-resolution video material and wanted to complement their dataset with labels that were equally high-quality.\n\nIn the early phases of the project, when experimenting with new sensors and training their models, zeroG worked directly in the Sama platform. This allowed them to work in an agile fashion, optimizing models early on in the process and enabling their experts to set a gold standard for high-quality labels. Once zeroG was ready to scale annotations, Sama annotators were able to hit the ground running. As Van Esch put it:\n\n“Sama allowed us to stay close to our data in the early stages of our project, to catch edge cases early and iterate on our instructions. By the time we were ready to scale, Sama’s workforce of annotators had a perfect understanding of the quality we needed for our models.”\n\nThis “nail it before you scale it” approach enabled zeroG to work iteratively and efficiently, in a fast-paced but controlled environment. Sama and zeroG teams remained in close communication with near-daily interaction, a collaborative approach that resulted in the delivery of a dataset at 97% quality SLA.\n\nWhat AI-powered insights can do for aviation\n\n\nHigh-quality labeled data is the fuel for zeroG’s mission to create more reliable turnaround data for airlines and airports. With more visibility into the end-to-end turnaround process, bottlenecks can be identified, and delays mitigated or even avoided entirely. This kind of unprecedented transparency has the potential to transform an opaque and reactive turnaround process into a measured and proactive one.\n\nUsing AI for real-time operations can help airlines and airports build a competitive advantage and drive real value: in the form of fewer delays, less waste, more secure work environments, and happier passengers.\n\n","relatedPosts":[{"_id":"edd6abc4-87b4-42db-a32a-15900a353dbf","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-30d0eaccd1e57322b31a4e16b84576ef1f8db57e-1920x960-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"zerog-aircraft-turnaround"},"tags":[{"label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management"},{"_id":"4d9c5816-3584-4622-8ea6-77869ca8dbf0","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f80b5e83a9927bafc61285d9e7a16b07070f53c1-1200x630-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sama-mila-partnership"},"tags":[{"_key":"ZLub2KFj","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"}],"title":"Sama Partners with Mila to Solve Key Problems in AI Development"},{"_id":"728400d2-d453-42f7-b20c-47f753bc4583","featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-1502043edcf701cb4267cb2f6d7c6edf8e0e0cad-2500x1313-png","_type":"reference"}},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"podcast-episode-facebook-manohar-paluri"},"tags":[{"_key":"6BgUw5oN","label":"Podcast","value":"Podcast"}],"title":"New Podcast Episode: Facebook's Manohar Paluri Makes Machines See"}],"seo_title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"zerog-aircraft-turnaround"},"tags":[{"label":"Case Studies","value":"Case Studies"}],"title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management"},"config":{"title":"High-Quality Labeled Data Fuels zeroG’s Mission to Optimize Aircraft Turnaround Management","description":"zeroG partnered with Sama to empower turnaround coordinators to make data-driven decisions that improve time efficiency, cut costs, and ensure safety.","openGraphImage":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/76e3r62u/production/30d0eaccd1e57322b31a4e16b84576ef1f8db57e-1920x960.png"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
