But succeeding in a field as nascent as AI requires more than just bright minds and an ambitious roadmap.\n\n\n\nA key ingredient to success – and one that is often overlooked – is a mindset of experimentation; a culture that encourages teams to solve issues in new and more efficient ways. Early on, we found that our teams thrive in this kind of environment, which is why this week, we’re wrapping up our third Innovation Week. \n\nThe concept is simple: for one week, anyone can work on a project they feel passionate about. During the week, you have free rein to work on whatever you please in whichever way you choose. There are no meetings and no interruptions. You are free to try new things, invent and learn. You can be part of a team or single-handedly run with your ideas.\n\nThis year, some exciting highlights include:\n\nA more efficient approach to video tracking and segmentation\n\nNew Smart Polygon tool that is able to greatly increase annotation efficiency\n\nEnhancing our platform through the introduction of a Sama CLI and data pre-processing capabilities\n\nThe atmosphere is incredible. The week starts with a kickoff, where everyone can present the problem they are trying to solve and how they are planning to solve it. The closing ceremony is called the “Grand Reveal,” where each individual or group demos what they worked on. It sometimes yields incredible presentations... other times, it doesn't.\n\nFreedom breeds creativity. These events have brought some of the most core and innovative components of our platform. Last year, over 50% of all Innovation Week projects were incorporated into our roadmap and implemented within the following two quarters. A perfect example of this is our MicroModel technology, which was initially borne from one of these projects. We now use this technology for Machine Assisted Annotation for deployments in the automotive and e-commerce industries.\n\nNot only does the event enhance our product, it also attracts talent. This year, we doubled our R&D team and are continuing to grow.\n\nInnovation Week gives our R&D team the space to do what they do best: observe, experiment and discover.\n\nInnovation Week is coming to a close, and once more, our teams have given us plenty to be excited about. As always, many of the projects are slated to appear on our platform. In particular, we saw lots of work around our new 3D LiDAR annotation automation and data processing… stay tuned for that.\n\nAt Sama, Innovation Week is designed to encourage experimentation by allowing teams to shift the focus from our immediate customer’s needs to a broader, more bold approach to Machine Learning. If that sounds fun to you, consider checking out the open roles on our R&D team here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"innovation-week-2021"},"tags":[{"_key":"DWf2I8xz","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"TUfn4bAi","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"imL766wL","label":"AI Practitioners","value":"AI Practitioners"}],"title":"Innovation Week: How Sama Builds a Culture of Experimentation"},{"_createdAt":"2021-03-23T19:00:21Z","author":{"_id":"4e2e7cef-d6eb-4bb7-bd39-375c6299677e","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1a274bcfdb5e70d814f1bab2b6bbd644728e9be-1480x1462-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"With a background in Computer Science, Abha leads the Customer Success Engineering team at Sama.

To define the correct annotation of given data, you want to start by creating annotation guidelines. On top of proposing a multi-level quality checks system, Sama’s experts have built unique know-how in efficiently designing annotation guidelines that enhance data quality.\n\nCue Gold Tasks; referring to tasks that have been annotated “perfectly” or meet the “gold standard”. Such tasks are often used by the client to communicate their expectations around precision and quality used as examples during training. At Sama, we use Gold Tasks in two more ways: During training, to assess annotators and identify those who are ready to move into production and during production to generate an automated metric on quality.\n\nGold Assessments\n\nEvery project launch at Sama is accompanied with a period of training, where annotators focus on requirements for the specific workflow, familiarizing themselves with the taxonomy, accuracy levels needed, and edge cases. Gold tasks come in as they move from classroom training to practice tasks.\n\nA gold set is created that is representative of the overall complexity of the dataset, ensuring a healthy mix of the edge cases. annotators practice on this set of which we already have “gold” answers. As each task is submitted we are able to compare the annotator answers with the gold task, generating custom metrics and error tags. The metrics are determined by the type of workflow and tool used, for e.g. in a semantic segmentation workflow, we focus on IoU calculations per label and depending on the client rubric each label may be weighed differently.\n\nThese metrics are then used to create trends and analyze each annotator’s performance individually, and provide relevant feedback. We are able to analyze trends at an asset label (which type of images are more difficult than others?), annotator level (which annotator is struggling exactly where?), and the impact of time (was today better than yesterday?).\n\nGold assessments, therefore, help us accelerate training by providing customized feedback to each annotator early on and allowing us to track their improvement over time. This enables Sama to quickly identify doubts, find edge cases, and have high confidence that annotators are ready to move on to production. Lastly, this allows us to calibrate and train the manual QAs on the specifics of this particular workflow, ensuring that nothing is missed.\n\n\nGold Metrics\n\nSimilar to gold assessments, gold metrics compare an annotator’s tasks against a known, completed task. These tasks, however, are interspersed within the production queue with the annotators unaware that these are gold tasks. These tasks then act as tests for the annotators, generating similar metrics as mentioned above. This allows the team to report upon the annotator’s performance against the gold tasks that increase insight into quality and help to further tailor training and coaching.\n\nGold metrics are most useful for clients looking to automate the quality loop on their side. Given that their Sama project team consistently samples and approves only high quality tasks, it is a neat way for them to save time and capacity.\n\nBecause no two AI projects are alike, you need to make sure that your quality assurance (QA) process is designed to meet the unique needs of your particular project.

What are automated quality accelerators and why should we care? Automated quality accelerators are technology innovations that are focused on reducing the amount of manual quality assurance time spent in QA processes. They may be used to expedite annotator education, generate automated measures of annotation quality, and prevent logical fallacies. Our accelerators are integrated into our Sama training data platform and can be customized for unique use cases and needs by our dedicated Customer Success Engineering team.\n\nWhile it’s key to have a human in the loop when creating and verifying training data, automating processes within the workflow improves efficiency while guaranteeing high quality, saving everyone time and money. Quality accelerators also focus the effort of Sama’s annotators towards the most challenging aspect of the task, minimizing the volume of manual rework they need to do, and catching mistakes early in the process —equipping them to do their job well. Ultimately, automated quality accelerators enable us to deliver super high-quality data for complex use cases in the most efficient manner.\n\n\n\nAutomated Quality Accelerators at Sama\n\nAutomated Logic Checks:\n\n\n\nAutomated Logic checks are triggered before a task is submitted on Sama by our annotators. Each task is assessed using a fixed set of rules to check for invalid combinations of labels within a shape, across all shapes, and dependencies with the metadata. These rules are flexible and customized to each workflow, focusing on all errors types that don’t need human judgement. If an error is found, the annotator needs to fix the task before it can be submitted. To help the annotator to fix the task and learn from their mistake, a message is displayed which contains shape specific error tags.\n\nAuto logic checks are optimized for different kinds of errors, including but not limited to:\n\nInvalid answer combinations: Combinations that the ontology prevents, for example more than two wheels being tagged on an item labeled “bicycle.”\n\nUniqueness or preventing repetitions: More than one object in an image being assigned the same unique identifier or the same label when the ontology prohibits that. For example, two noses in a single person keypoints workflow.\n\nSize requirements: Ensuring that size specifications are met. For example, guaranteeing consistent size in a 3D workflow where constant cuboid size is required or enforcing a minimum pixel rule\n\nRelational checks: Given attributes and sub-attributes, ensure that values selected aren’t contradictory. For example, a bicyclist polygon isn’t grouped/attached to a car bounding box\n\nThese checks are incredibly efficient for the following reasons:\n\nCreate an instant feedback loop to prevent logical fallacies, which helps annotators improve and get it right the first time\n\nPrevents errors that may be impossible to detect by a manual QA review processes\n\nReduces time spent by manual QAs and allow them to focus on the more critical errors or sample more tasks\n\nHelps annotators to adapt quickly to changing project instructions, ensuring that new instructions are being followed and are understood correctly\n\nLastly, it improves overall TPT and reduces the time from task creation to delivery\n\nUnder a strictly manual process, highly skilled quality assurance annotators would need to review and provide feedback manually. While the latter process is still a vital part of our human-in-the-loop data annotation, auto logic checks free up their expertise to focus on more subjective errors and edge cases.\n\nOur enterprise-level clients are successfully using Sama Quality Accelerators to realize extremely high data quality for their most complex use cases, improving overall model performance.

The ability to identify specific keypoint landmarks and track their relationship to one another is unlocking some of the most interesting developments in computer vision technology. This includes motion tracking like human pose identification for virtual fitness trainers or sports analytics. It also includes facial landmarks for emotion analysis, facial verification security, or driver alertness detection. It could also include hand gesture control for AR/VR or sign language transcription.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce our support for custom keypoint shapes in our training data platform trusted by the world's leading AI teams, for vector image and video annotation. While Sama has long supported other vector shapes like bounding boxes, polygons, and cuboids, these keypoint use cases require custom shapes that have a predefined number and order of points. Sama can now be configured to support skeletons, hands, eyelids or any other complex custom shape. Each keypoint can have its own label, color, and connection to other points. Multiple keypoint shapes are supported on the same annotation project.\n\n\nOptimizing for Quality and Efficiency\n\nThis new capability optimizes quality and efficiency in producing ground truth training data for our clients. Our expert annotators have a facilitated drawing experience where the shape builds itself as they annotate each point. The correct label for each point is inferred from the order that it is placed so no extra time is spent assigning labels to each point. We see quality improvement from visualizing the annotations as a cohesive connected shape instead of as free standing individual points. The custom keypoint shape also always has the same number and order of points—this means that no points could ever be omitted or mislabeled. In addition to the quality benefits, our A/B testing showed an 27% decrease in annotation time on a skeleton image annotation workflow over individual points.\n\nCompleted annotation data is returned to our clients in a structured delivery format that contains information about each point, its relative order in the array and its connection to other points.\n\nIf you're currently working on a computer vision algorithm that requires high quality keypoint annotations on images or videos, make sure to read more on our platform page or get in touch with an expert to discuss your training data needs.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"custom-keypoint-shapes"},"tags":[{"_key":"T7HkzkJx","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"j9XlG6o5","label":"Keypoints","value":"Keypoints"},{"_key":"o2UoWoaC","label":"Video Annotation","value":"Video Annotation"},{"_key":"3GbpMBcq","label":"Vector Annotation","value":"Vector Annotation"}],"title":"Custom Keypoint Shapes for Vector Image & Video Annotation"},{"_createdAt":"2020-04-02T20:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

To assist top organizations in their efforts to build smarter computer vision algorithms, we’ve rolled out a new release for video and 3D object-tracking in our leading data annotation platform.\n\nThere are a number of applications that use computer vision to track how the world, and the objects in it, change overtime. For a self-driving car to navigate safely, it needs to track other moving objects on the road and make predictions about their future movement, so it can plan its driving path.\n\nAR and VR applications like video games need to track the motion of individual people to create a seamless digital experience. These vision applications have something in common: they all seek to understand the change in position, behavior and characteristics of unique objects over time.\n\nObject tracking annotation offers object tracking capabilities for complex scenarios, including path planning, traffic light status, sentiment analysis, etc.\n\nThis frame-level labeling technology allows unique objects to be dynamically tracked across a video or a sequence of 3D point cloud data from a Lidar sensor. Change in position and pose are captured with annotation shapes like cuboids, polygons and bounding boxes.\n\nSama supports custom label taxonomies for both the main object class (person, car, etc.) and dynamic labeling for other object characteristics that change over time, such as visibility percentage of an object or a specific set of characteristics like emotions. Sama’s built-in automated interpolation between video frames helps ensure efficient, high quality labeled training data for a variety of object tracking use cases.\n\nFor over 10 years, Sama has delivered turnkey, high-quality training data and validation to train the world's leading AI technologies. Video and 3D object tracking are no exception, and this update for video object tracking annotation in 2D RGB video and 3D Lidar data will continue to assist organizations in quickly building models that better reflect real-world behavior.\n\nSama has deep expertise working with training data for object tracking use cases across a variety of industries including autonomous vehicles, AR/VR, retail and e-commerce, communications, media and entertainment, to name just a few.\n\nDownload our solution brief to learn more about our secure training data annotation platform, or contact our team here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"object-tracking-in-samahub-with-frame-level-labeling"},"tags":[{"_key":"OjIX5QKU","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"2ZGxEWq0","label":"Video Annotation","value":"Video Annotation"},{"_key":"iBmdS1VE","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"uZYhm6jx","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"Object Tracking with Frame Level-Labeling"},{"_createdAt":"2020-03-26T16:49:42Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

This technology enables obscuring of sensitive, personally identifying information (PII) in training data.\n\nIn light of new laws like GDPR and CCPA, it’s important for companies building AI and ML technologies to carefully manage data with PII information. Obscuring PII helps Sama and our customers work to protect privacy.\n\nSama’s PII Data Anonymizer helps make more data available to train AI by keeping personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources: People in camera images from retail spaces and public places, street-level images of people and license plates captured by vehicles, smart city applications on public transit and more.\n\nApplications for anonymization range from autonomous transportation, detailed customer demographics, customer data like clothing and emotion, people counters, and security.\n\nThis deep learning pre-annotation technology allows Sama to obscure faces and vehicle license plates that appear in data without the need for any human intervention. That means that private information remains private and is never seen by another person.\n\n\n\nWhen Sama receives customer data, it can be run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs. The service would automatically detect faces and license plates and obscure them, as well as blur faces and license plates so they are not recognizable.\n\nAlternatively, it can replace faces and license plates with realistic computer-generated avatars. This AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm.\n\nUnlike manual blurring, Sama’s PII Data Anonymizer is run without a human examining the data, which contributes to the privacy of PII data. It is built on deep learning and is run within our technology platform, ensuring that customer data never leaves Sama’s secure cloud environment.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Sama securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech.

Why shouldn't your AI?\n\nToday, we're announcing the production availability of our new 3D annotation engine for the Sama. This new offering allows our expert annotation team to nimbly explore your lidar point clouds, searching for objects of interest and producing the highest quality 3D labels.\n\nAs much as we love a good \"3D\" joke, we can't leave out the important 4th dimension -- time. Building on the object tracking expertise from our video annotation toolkit, we support lengthy sequences of point cloud data, tracking moving objects through time and space.\n\nWAIT, WHAT ARE POINT CLOUDS?\n\nBefore we get too deep into the weeds on 3D annotation, let's take a step back and talk about 3D point clouds and why they are important.\n\nThroughout the history of computer vision technology, two-dimensional camera images have dominated. Techniques to detect edges and extract objects from the background, approaches to estimate relative distances in order to construct implied dimensions, and carefully-calibrated dual-camera captures that triangulate all incrementally nudged forward a machine's ability to \"see.\"\n\nAdvances in deep neural nets dramatically improved computer vision with a greater degree of robustness -- and kicked off the current race to bring self-driving cars to market.\n\nCars are heavy and filled with combustible material. They travel at high velocities. They share the same space as other hurtling vehicles, ambling humans, and wandering animals. This makes the perception of distance absolutely critical. Recognizing an obstruction in the road is step 1; step 2 is estimating distance and making the appropriate response (slam on the brakes? maneuver safely around?).\n\nHence, lidar technology has been rapidly adopted as the key enabler for self-driving cars. Kyle Vogt, CEO of GM Cruise, says, “sensors are a critical enabler for deploying self-driving cars at scale, and LIDARs are currently the bottleneck.” Rapid innovation to make lidar sensors faster, smaller, and cheaper with higher density, higher accuracy data make adoption near inevitable.\n\nWhat does the data look like? Rather than a 2D image displayed on a flat screen, a lidar sensor generates a 3D snapshot of the surrounding environment. It scans the area with pinpricks of light, measuring the time-of-flight of reflections, and thus precisely capturing a collection of (X, Y, Z) points. We can reconstruct this to display on our screens, much like an Xbox game.\n\nThe richness and fidelity of this type of data feeds a new generation of AI algorithms (e.g., see this paper about deep neural nets with direct voxel inputs by Apple), making depth perception much easier.\n\nMUCH MORE THAN SELF-DRIVING CARS\n\nIt's not just self-driving cars. 3D point clouds power a variety of machine vision use cases.\n\nWhile an autonomous vehicle may use a technique like SLAM to dynamically build a 3D map of the environment, providers of high fidelity mapping data collect their own point clouds so that they can provide the ground-truth reference map. For example, providers like HERE could build 3D into their HD Localization maps.\n\nDelivery robots are another exciting use case for lidar sensor based perception. The navigation concepts are very similar to automotive, but many delivery robots can more easily traverse sidewalks and coexist with pedestrians.\n\nIn a warehouse context, robots with 3D lidar sensing are able to shift materials around, rapidly picking up and transporting pallets to reconfigure the warehouse or optimize manufacturing workflows. Collision avoidance in the presence of human operators as well as indoor navigation and mapping round out the common ways that 3D point cloud data power cognitive robots.\n\nFinally, unmanned aerial vehicles -- otherwise known as drones -- can use lidar to collect high resolution 3D data, such as when \"corridor mapping\" a pipeline, surveying a construction site, or performing visual structural inspections.\n\nEmpowering the Human Element\n\nSama has extensive project experience annotating lidar sensor data from cutting-edge instruments. While we quickly ramped projects to produce those annotations on our clients’ own in-house apps, we wanted to create a tool flexible enough for the broader market.\n\nThat's why we're launching our 3D annotation tool that supports a wide range of 3D data types from essentially all lidar sensors. We have likely worked with sensor data from your lidar vendor of choice.\n\nThere's more to it beyond the raw data.\n\nThe Sama mission is to use human ingenuity to accelerate AI development, and one of our favorite tricks is to use algorithms to assist and interact with our expert human annotators. Our new 3D tool has some powerful time-saving features such as:\n\nautomatic cuboid estimation to quickly capture an entire object after clicking only a single point;\n\nautomatic ground-plan extraction to make objects and environs easier to discriminate;\n\nsynchronized camera images for 2D confirmation of the 3D points; and\n\nobject tracking estimation to accelerate annotation and predict movement even when objects are occluded or only partially visible\n\nThis approach lets us combine the skills of expert annotators, who can cleverly correlate what a camera shows with even sparse point clouds, with algorithms to accelerate the manipulation of 3D annotations in space and time. Together, we rapidly produce ground-truth annotations of the highest quality to power 3D perception.\n\nThe bottom line: our clients get to market faster with their latest 3D perception algorithms. Quality and throughput make a difference.\n\nExperience Matters\n\nWe have run many projects through our teams, and consistently produce the quality results made possible only by long-term, dedicated annotation experts. The Sama model allows our agents to concentrate on a single client's data, understanding the nuances and unique requirements of their machine learning team (e.g., how precisely to enclose an object, whether to include side-view mirrors or bicycle racks, how to treat objects that pass out of view, what constitutes sufficient visual contact, and so on).\n\nOne project included side-mounted lidar sensors that produced data rotated by 90 degrees. Rather than expecting our team to annotate with their necks tilted at an angle, our engineering team whipped up a quick \"rotate camera\" tool to quickly reorient the workspace. Between continuous improvements of our Hub annotation studio, iterative refinement of the project objectives and annotation goals, and experience with point cloud data from nearly every lidar sensor out there, there's a bright future in 3D annotation here at Sama.\n\nPartnering with Sama, you can get the most from your 3D lidar projects. We’re incredibly excited about this production-ready 3D annotation tool and the future of high-performance lidar.

These new tools, in the hands of our expert annotation workforce, level up Sama’s object tracking performance while maintaining the same extreme quality results of our ground truth training data services.\n\nWhat this means for our customers is an even more scalable approach to annotating the growing stream of video object tracking data. Faster training data production speeds your algorithm development and gets you to market faster.\n\nWhy focus on video object tracking?\n\nTesla, as an example, has over 250,000 cars on the road, each packed with high quality cameras to capture the world around them. Video footage collected from a fleet of this size can feed an extremely sophisticated autonomous driving deep learning system. And it's not just Tesla. In the Bay Area, we've become accustomed to seeing data capture vehicles from just about every autonomous driving company out there -- and all of them are collecting video.\n\nAs the computer vision industry progresses from simple object identification (can the algorithm tell what an object is?) to object tracking (can the algorithm follow a specific object over time?), we need tools that can effortlessly annotate this video stream. Sama delivers.\n\nWhat difference does a tool make?\n\nThe traditional approach to an object tracking project is to split the video into individual images and then annotate each image separately, paying careful attention to ensure consistent identifiers for each unique object in sequential images. It's very challenging work, as any Sama agent or quality analyst will tell you. It takes careful attention to detail and often exceeds the capabilities of most annotation services. (We had to build some supporting tools in our platform to make it tractable.)\n\nSama’s introduction of video annotation for object tracking completely changes the game. Now, an entire video sequence can be assessed as a whole, whether the clip contains 2 frames or 2,000 frames. This feature makes it much easier and faster to follow a single object -- even if it's moving -- from beginning to end of a video. If the object disappears from the camera view and reenters later (think: overtaking a cyclist in traffic, only to have them blow past you at the next intersection), we can easily, accurately accommodate it. The whole process is more efficient while maintaining the highest annotation quality, especially as the density of objects increases. And believe me, image complexity at the cutting edge of computer vision is getting up there.\n\nNo, really, why are you so excited?\n\nOne of the coolest aspects of the new tool is how it semi-automatically annotates frames, which makes for a more efficient workflow. If a user starts by drawing a bounding box around an object, the tool automatically estimates the object's location in subsequent or previous frames. Our expert annotation workforce carefully scrutinizes those estimates, and manually tweaks them as needed to get the tracking fully dialed in.\n\nWhen we think about where to focus our platform development, we're always looking for ways to augment the capabilities of our human workforce. We think about how we can make our data services better by using technology to make our team more efficient and more accurate -- with ever more complicated annotation projects. Video annotation is a very visceral demonstration of this approach.\n\n\n\n(By the way, the process couldn't be easier for customers. Hand over camera footage -- color, b&w, high frame rate, low frame, SD, UHD, whatever -- to our project team, and we manage the entire project from start to finish, delivering annotation results that you can immediately route into your training pipeline.)\n\n\nThat’s a wrap!\n\nIt's the leveling up in the speed -- with the highest accuracy -- of our ground truth training data annotation service that really matters. We work with a many clients developing sophisticated vision algorithms, with very aggressive targets for annotation completeness and correctness. Ground truth training data is precious and object tracking video sequences particularly so. Data scientists need confidence in the quality of that training data so that they squeeze the maximum performance out of their deep learning models, focusing on the architecture and hyper-parameter tuning instead of grooming erroneous data.\n\nPartnering with Sama, you can get the most from your object tracking projects. We’re proud of this production-ready video annotation tool, and have big plans for evolving it.
