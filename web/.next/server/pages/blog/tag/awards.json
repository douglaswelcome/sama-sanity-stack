Through it all, our team at Sama has remained committed to providing leading companies with the highest quality training data to get predictably higher accuracy in half the time. That’s because we know that AI is the key to the future of technology, and without diverse and accurate data sets, the technology will ultimately fail.\n\nThanks to our industry-spanning work with partners such as Walmart, Google and NVIDIA, we are honored to announce our inclusion in the 2021 Forbes AI 50 list alongside leading companies including Duolingo, Samsara and Narrativ. In its third year, the Forbes AI 50 highlights the most promising North American businesses using AI in ways that are fundamental to their operations.\n\nBy combining our expert-human-in-the-loop team with cutting-edge technology, we’ve put in the time and effort to perfect our machine learning-assisted annotation and achieve SLAs well above the industry standard this past year. With new innovations like our AI Bias Detection solution and milestones, including our B Corp Certification, we’ve continued to prioritize our double bottom line, measuring our success not only in terms of revenue but also impact.\n\n\"I’m incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished over the past year both in terms of our success providing high-quality data to industry leaders and maintaining our commitment to social impact,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “As AI becomes increasingly essential to operations across industries, we’re excited to have a hand in the future of effective, non-biased AI, and are grateful to be recognized as one of the leading companies in the space.\"\n\nThis recognition from Forbes reflects our continued success in leveraging AI for good. Through partnerships with customers to help hotels and restaurants achieve zero food waste, power anti-poaching and animal conservation efforts, enable safe and effective robot-assisted surgery and more, we’re consistently harnessing best-in-class technology to address the most pressing challenges in our society today. \n\nTo learn more about our achievements and to see the complete list of Forbes AI 50 winners, visit Forbes' article here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"sama-recognized-in-the-2021-forbes-ai-50-list"},"tags":[{"_key":"RgPudZ6F","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"kLwgMkEb","label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"Sama Recognized in the 2021 Forbes AI 50 List"},{"_createdAt":"2020-08-26T18:18:07Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

From our social-impact business model and training programs that help individuals lift themselves out of poverty to partnerships with the organizations creating change across industries, we’ve always believed in accurate AI’s ability to change our world for the better.\n\n\n\nThat’s why we’re honored to announce today that we’ve been recognized in Fast Company’s first-ever list of the Next Big Things in Tech for our work with our partners at Orbisk.\n\n\n\nHighlighting the new technological breakthroughs that promise to help define the future of the industries they serve, Next Big Things In Tech finds the products, services, features, research, and other technology efforts having a positive impact on consumers, businesses, or society at large in the next five years.\n\n“The climate crisis is growing increasingly dire each day. Right now, between 8-10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the direct result of food waste,” said Wendy Gonzalez, CEO at Sama. “As we work to find ways to be more environmentally conscious, we were inspired by the team at Orbisk’s vision for the future of food service. Together, we’re incredibly proud of the solution we’ve built and its impact in minimizing waste production.”\n\nEach year, 931 million tonnes of food end up in landfills, and of that, nearly 362 million tonnes come from the foodservice and retail industries. With Sama’s high-quality training data powering its algorithm, Orbisk’s fully automated food waste monitor allows hotels, restaurants, and cafés to reduce food waste by up to 70%. \n\nOrbisk’s solution works by scanning plates of food to detect and record what items are being thrown away automatically and their quantities. With this data, businesses can make smarter choices that help save money while reducing food waste. To ensure accuracy, Sama successfully labeled hundreds of thousands of images of food, rapidly iterating to reach consistent attribute tagging. This allows Orbisk to improve accuracy and build a robust product capable of accurately recognizing food of all kinds in all steps of the cooking process.\n\nTo date, our partnership has enabled businesses to reduce an average of 8,000lbs of food waste per year. In total, prototyping projects alone have saved over 220,400lbs to date, and we’re aiming to reach over 220,000,000lbs saved annually by 2025.\n\n“Fast Company is thrilled to highlight cutting-edge technologies that are solving real-world problems in unexpected ways. From climate change and public health crises to machine learning and security, these technologies will certainly have a profound impact on the future, and we’re honored to bring attention to them today,” says Stephanie Mehta, editor-in-chief of Fast Company.\n\nTogether, we look forward to helping reduce the rate of climate warming by mitigating food waste.\n\nLearn more about our partnership and its success here, or check out the full list of Fast Company's Next Big Things in Tech here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fast-company-next-best-things-tech-2021"},"tags":[{"label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"Orbisk’s Sama-Powered Food Waste Solution Named to Fast Company’s First-Ever List of the Next Big Things in Tech"},{"_createdAt":"2021-05-05T16:24:03Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.
