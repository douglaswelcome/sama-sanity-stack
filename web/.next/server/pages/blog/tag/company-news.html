Right now, between 8-10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the direct result of food waste,” said Wendy Gonzalez, CEO at Sama. “As we work to find ways to be more environmentally conscious, we were inspired by the team at Orbisk’s vision for the future of food service. Together, we’re incredibly proud of the solution we’ve built and its impact in minimizing waste production.”\n\nEach year, 931 million tonnes of food end up in landfills, and of that, nearly 362 million tonnes come from the foodservice and retail industries. With Sama’s high-quality training data powering its algorithm, Orbisk’s fully automated food waste monitor allows hotels, restaurants, and cafés to reduce food waste by up to 70%. \n\nOrbisk’s solution works by scanning plates of food to detect and record what items are being thrown away automatically and their quantities. With this data, businesses can make smarter choices that help save money while reducing food waste. To ensure accuracy, Sama successfully labeled hundreds of thousands of images of food, rapidly iterating to reach consistent attribute tagging. This allows Orbisk to improve accuracy and build a robust product capable of accurately recognizing food of all kinds in all steps of the cooking process.\n\nTo date, our partnership has enabled businesses to reduce an average of 8,000lbs of food waste per year. In total, prototyping projects alone have saved over 220,400lbs to date, and we’re aiming to reach over 220,000,000lbs saved annually by 2025.\n\n“Fast Company is thrilled to highlight cutting-edge technologies that are solving real-world problems in unexpected ways.

This marks the transition from solidifying product-market fit to truly taking the business and impact to scale.\n\nOn the road to Series B, Sama has received many recognitions for its innovative technology and impact sourcing model, including inclusion on the Forbes AI 50 and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas lists.\n\nThat said, getting to this milestone has not been straightforward. The team had to overcome the “valley of death” and bust many myths along the way. One by one. A few of them are highlighted below, cementing the viability of purpose-driven companies and hopefully inspiring others to bust myths on their path to purpose and profitability.\n\nMyth #1: Impact requires a trade-off between purpose and profit\n\nAlthough impact investing has become more mainstream over the past decade, the notion that there is a trade-off between impact and financial return is still very much alive — despite academic evidence pointing to the opposite. While purpose-driven companies may integrate impact in their business models in different ways, Sama’s Series B raise solidifies the fact that there is no trade-off between purpose and profit as you grow, when impact is inherent to your value proposition and product. \n\nThe company partners with big corporations—Google, NVIDIA, Walmart—to provide them with quality data to train their machine learning models. Sama provides high-quality annotated text, images, and videos for a range of use-cases, powering robot-assisted surgery, autonomous vehicles, personalized online shopping experiences, and more. Sama hires over 90% of its workforce from low-income backgrounds and marginalized populations in Kenya and Uganda, training them and granting them employment in the digital economy. What’s more, Sama is an anti-ghost work company. Each of its employees is hired ethically and receives fair compensation and benefits. \n\nFor over 10 years, Sama has partnered with leading global brands. Their stellar commercial performance has been achieved as they continue to scale opportunities for underserved individuals through the digital economy. Sama was one of the first AI companies to become B-Corp certified and has helped over 56,000 people lift themselves out of poverty. Its training and employment program was recently validated by an MIT-led Randomized Controlled Trial, confirming the effectiveness of its impact sourcing model by demonstrating that individuals that received both training and inclusion in Sama’s hiring pool exhibited lower unemployment rates and higher average monthly earnings.\n\n\"Sama’s openness to evaluate the impact of their programs with the rigor of a randomized control trial was refreshing and shows that they’re a leader in the movement toward ethical practices within the AI industry.\"\n-David Atkin, Professor of Economics, MIT\n\nMyth #2: Diversity is a pipeline problem\n\nWe have all seen the data in one shape or form: white men get the lion’s share of investor funding. Despite the movements calling for diversity, women-led startups account for just 2.2% (https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard) of the $150 billion invested in companies by VCs annually. Many have argued that the lack of diversity is caused by a pipeline problem, that there simply are not enough qualified investment opportunities – especially as it regards tech businesses. With the Series B raise, Sama paves the way for busting the myth once and for all. \n\nSama is a female-founded and led tech company that is deploying an impact sourcing model creating opportunities for marginalized communities, with over half of Sama agents intentionally being women. Founded by late Laila Janah and now led by CEO Wendy Gonzalez, the company has achieved responsible hyper-growth, and consequently, for the second year, a spot on the Inc. 5000 list as one of America’s fastest-growing private companies. The data speaks for itself.\n\nSama’s Series B raise represents the largest round for a female-led AI infrastructure in history. The round is led by CDPQ’s Equity253 fund that targets companies that leverage diversity and inclusion as a vector of development. The fund is put in motion because studies clearly validate that diversity in companies fosters better decision-making and has a positive impact on innovation, risk management, productivity, and financial performance. \n\n\"At the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION the rationale for investing in diversity is also clear – not only for profit and for purpose, but also to ensure structural change through the positive ripple effects that transcends generations. Sama embodies such rationale by improving employment and income for those with the greatest barriers to work and changing the narrative for their dependents\"\n- Anne Cathrine Garde, Investment Manager and Head of Scaleups.\n\nMyth #3: Impact does not fit the venture capital model\n\nSama was started as a non-profit organization because no one believed it could ever be a business. When late-founder Laila Janah pitched venture capitalists on Sandy Hill Road, the impact sourcing model was disregarded as it did not fit the typical parameters of hyper-growth and capital efficiency. On the opposite side of the spectrum, grant givers did not believe that impact sourcing could meet the basic needs of the marginalized communities. Sama proved both groups wrong. The company was ahead of its time, but luckily the landscape has changed a lot since then, and with the Series B raise, Sama is showcasing that impact is fit for staged financing.\n\n\n\nSince 2015, with Wendy Gonzalez on board, the company has focused on building a repeatable and scalable business model. From 2016 and onwards, Sama sustained itself on earned revenues and became a profitable nonprofit. With the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION investment in 2017, the Kenyan subsidiary was transformed from a non-profit to a for-profit company.\n\nJannek Hagen, Managing Director was a part of the team driving the investment decision:\n\n\"We invested in Sama Kenya back in 2017 as the first investor. Since then, we have witnessed how the team has transformed from a not-for-profit to a full-fledged, for-profit AI technology company\".\n\nThe investment set the precedent for Sama at group level to be transformed into a for-profit to attract further financing, talent, and expertise the following year. In 2019, Sama completed their USD 14.8M Series A funding with venture capital Ridge Ventures leading the round supported by Social Impact Ventures, Bluecrest Limited Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and BESTSELLER FOUNDATION.\n\nToday, Sama has taken the next step in its journey with the Series B raise that will take its purpose and profitability to new scales. In 2021, the landscape of impact investing looks different with the proliferation of many asset classes that are embracing an impact lens, covering the whole investment lifecycle. The time for launching an impact business is ripe and a big recognition goes to founders like Leila Janah, who ahead of her time proved the viability of purpose-driven businesses.\n\nLet us bust more myths together, one by one!\n\nHow are you busting the myths of impact? In a Sub-Saharan African context, where Sama and the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION have a strong presence, the journey towards impact equilibrium is twofold. Let us jointly normalize the concept of purpose-driven businesses while highlighting and measuring the impact that is happening on the ground. Our goal is to continue to ensure that impact is not diluted or misrepresented but used as a competitive advantage.\n\n**This post was jointly authored by Anne Cathrine Garde, BESTSELLER FOUNDATION and Amanda Durepos, Sama.**\n\n---\n\nAbout BESTSELLER FOUNDATION: We support entrepreneurs and invest in businesses that work for supporting the wellbeing of our natural world, for creating better jobs and opportunity, for sustainable growth.

Since Day 1, we’ve been committed to building technology that has a positive impact — across industries, but also across the globe.\n\nThis is no small task, and we’ve been busy since announcing our Series A funding in 2019. \n\nWe have opened offices in Kampala, Uganda, and Montreal, and Samasource became Sama.

She was interviewing me and spoke excitedly about the potential of Sama achieving B Corp certification, one of her main priorities for the company. In the next breath, she talked about dominating the training data industry and catapulting Sama to claim its much-earned spot in the AI landscape.\n\nThis introduction was just the first of many conversations we would later have on the importance of sustainability, impact, and responsible hyper-growth.\n\nI’m deeply humbled and honored to announce that, as of today, Sama is among the first AI companies to receive the prestigious B Corp certification. The achievement comes on the heels of completing our three-year Randomized Control Trial (RCT), which demonstrated the actualized impact of our hybrid model and continued commitment to fusing purpose and profit, both internally and externally.\n\n\n\n“This achievement is the result of years of hard work and dedication from our entire Sama community. By securing B Corp certification and completing our RCT, we’re not only carrying Leila’s passion and commitment to impact, but we’re making a tremendous stride within the AI industry,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “I’d like to extend immense thanks to everyone who played a part in making Leila’s dream a reality.”\n\n\n\nB Corp certification is a measurement certified by B Lab, a non-profit company that measures a company’s social and environmental performance. We received a score of 98.5, excelling in the ‘Workers' and 'Community Impact' criteria, and placing us well above the 80 points necessary to achieve B Corporation status. Of the 3,500+ Certified B Corporations, Sama is the first and only AI company recognized and joins companies such as WeTransfer, Patagonia, Hootsuite, and Ben \u0026 Jerry’s, all who use business as a force for good.\n\nThree years ago, Leila kicked off what would become a rigorous journey towards completing a full RCT. This in-depth trial, often referred to as the \"gold standard\" in research, evaluated our training and employment effectiveness towards our mission of creating a sustainable pathway out of poverty. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive either training through Sama (Group 1), training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\nOne of the trial’s main findings is that individuals who are trained and employed by Sama make higher levels of employment and earnings (Group 2). This study and subsequent completion of the RCT further validated the training programs we’ve created at Sama, an impact model that has helped 50,000 people lift themselves out of poverty, increased wages by 4x, and provided over 11,000 hours of training. \n\nBecoming B Corp certified and completing an RCT in tandem is a direct example of how our team at Sama is leveraging AI to address critical societal issues. This year has proved that making a real impact and having a mission-driven business model is what truly matters in driving the bottom line.

We’re thankful for this recognition and are inspired to continue our work in driving AI forward.”\n\nIn 2019, the UN reported that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history. We are causing a devastating impact on global biodiversity, with nearly one million animal and plant species threatened by extinction. In an effort to mitigate this, our expert annotators applied our technology to advance AI algorithms, powering one of the leading wildlife conservation efforts with Vulcan, a project and investment company that uses data to make a positive impact on endangered species, climate change, ocean health, and more.\n\nThrough our work with Vulcan, we were able to address the current threat of wildlife trafficking while collecting data that will inform long-term strategies to protect endangered species and ensure stable and thriving generations. Through our technology, Vulcan has significantly improved its turnaround times to process training data, allowing algorithms to thrive without compromising on quality. To date, we have labeled nearly one million images for Vulcan, achieving above industry-standard quality SLA of 95% in support of their efforts. Together, we are combating large-scale poaching that contributes to extinction, while supporting a more sustainable ecosystem through image processing solutions.\n\nThe annual awards program honors AI excellence, innovation and success in a range of AI and machine learning related categories, including AI and Machine Learning Platforms, Smart Robotics, Business Intelligence and Analytics, Natural Language Processing, industry-specific AI applications and many more.

This systemic challenge we face requires not only immediate action. It requires a change in the way we think, see, and operate.\n\nTrue change happens with purposeful action and in the decisions we make every day. It takes investment for the long term, even when there is pressure to perform in the short term. As I’ve been telling my teams as we organize to contribute the fight for justice for Black people, “We are in a marathon, not a sprint.”\n\nI also firmly believe that change starts locally. It starts with us as individuals and within our communities.\n\nLastly, change needs to be measurable - not just this quarter or next, but on an ongoing basis. We need to hold ourselves accountable to ensure we’re making positive progress toward a more just, equitable society. Since our founding in 2008, we have treated our impact metrics with the same level of fidelity and reporting as we have our financials. We will apply the same rigor of measure to the Black Lives Matter engagement strategy and actions I’m committing to today.\n\nFollowing our company values, we’ve decided to take action both inside our organization and in partnership with local organizations to drive toward a more equitable society where Black people in America realize the same level of humanity as others.\n\nI’m committing to four core initiatives to support racial inclusion.\n\nFinancial Support: Earlier this week, we launched a corporate matching program to raise donations for three local organizations. Sama seeded this program with funds and is matching each employee donation 2:1. The three local organizations include:\n\nCode2040, a San Francisco based nonprofit activating, connecting, and mobilizing the largest racial equity community in tech to dismantle the structural barriers that prevent Black and Latinx technologists from fully participating in the tech industry.\n\nAI4ALL, an Oakland based non-profit lead by a Sama alum, opens doors to artificial intelligence for underrepresented talent through education and mentorship.\n\nColor Of Change, an Oakland based organization, is the nation’s largest online justice organization. They design campaigns powerful enough to end practices that hold Black people back, and champion solutions that move us all forward.\n\nHoodstock, a Montreal based organization, generates spaces for dialogue and mobilizing initiatives to eliminate systemic inequalities and develop supportive, inclusive, secure and dynamic communities.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: While we have rigorous programs in place to address gender diversity and inclusion, and enjoy a cross-cultural mix of people within our organization, we found that our North American diversity representation could be improved. To achieve this goal, we’re committing to expand our gender diversity and inclusion program to specifically include inclusion metrics for Black and other people of color.\n\nInternal Education: We are committed to hosting internal education and engagement sessions covering topics such as institutional racism, racial bias in AI, diversity hiring best practices, and the importance of voting. We also started an internal forum for our teams to openly exchange ideas for action and provide additional support to each other.\n\nPartnerships: We are engaging with partners within the AI community committed to better understanding and taking action against AI Bias. We’re also engaging with organizations that support upskilling, mentoring, and recruitment to drive economic mobility and inclusion for Black Americans in the tech industry.\n\nMy hope is that everyone in our broader technology community will drive the change needed to make the United States a more equitable and inclusive country. We must stand together and bring humanity to our industry, and to our country.\n\n(In case you missed it, below is our original statement. )\n\nThe murder of George Floyd has reignited an international movement for equality and justice. It sparked a powder keg of emotions that have left many feeling frustrated, helpless, angry, outraged, and sad. We here at Sama stand by one of our core company values -- Humanity. Humanity for the countless number of Black lives who have been victims of police brutality. Humanity for every person that tries to survive daily in a system that routinely oppresses them. Humanity for those who so often do not receive it, all because of the color of their skin.\n\nThe world of tech so often speaks of creating a new, better world -- but we cannot do that if we do not stand for the rights of everyone. Humanity and compassion are necessary. In order to avoid bias in ourselves and the technology we produce, we must consider how daily actions, words, and thoughts contribute to a racist and prejudiced world.\n\nTo quote our late founder Leila Janah, “Don’t underestimate the ripple effect of what you do. These kinds of small actions undertaken in coordination by large numbers of people have toppled empires.” We stand in solidarity with those driving positive change. Here is a list of resources we found helpful.","seo_title":"Underscoring Our Commitment to Racial Justice and Equality","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"our-commitment-to-racial-justice-and-equality"},"tags":[{"_key":"ceQUdDQq","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"Ac6EgzO1","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"s1l8UVKZ","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Underscoring Our Commitment to Racial Justice and Equality"},{"_createdAt":"2020-05-12T16:08:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

At the end of the assessment, it will provide you resources that correlate with your medical inquiry. But we know that having a clear sense of mind doesn’t stop there.

Our team at Sama makes Chloe smarter by helping her understand the human language. We have real people behind the chatbot, annotating every data asset to help ensure that citizens are getting the most accurate information available in real-time.\n\nWe believe that it’s our obligation to use our industry-leading annotation solutions to help as many people as possible navigate these trying times. Our goal is to provide a safe service with truthful, current and accurate information for everyone. We hope that you’ll sign up and take advantage of this free service.
