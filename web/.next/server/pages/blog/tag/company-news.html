This marks the transition from solidifying product-market fit to truly taking the business and impact to scale.\n\nOn the road to Series B, Sama has received many recognitions for its innovative technology and impact sourcing model, including inclusion on the Forbes AI 50 and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas lists.\n\nThat said, getting to this milestone has not been straightforward. The team had to overcome the “valley of death” and bust many myths along the way. One by one. A few of them are highlighted below, cementing the viability of purpose-driven companies and hopefully inspiring others to bust myths on their path to purpose and profitability.\n\nMyth #1: Impact requires a trade-off between purpose and profit\n\nAlthough impact investing has become more mainstream over the past decade, the notion that there is a trade-off between impact and financial return is still very much alive — despite academic evidence pointing to the opposite. While purpose-driven companies may integrate impact in their business models in different ways, Sama’s Series B raise solidifies the fact that there is no trade-off between purpose and profit as you grow, when impact is inherent to your value proposition and product. \n\nThe company partners with big corporations—Google, NVIDIA, Walmart—to provide them with quality data to train their machine learning models. Sama provides high-quality annotated text, images, and videos for a range of use-cases, powering robot-assisted surgery, autonomous vehicles, personalized online shopping experiences, and more. Sama hires over 90% of its workforce from low-income backgrounds and marginalized populations in Kenya and Uganda, training them and granting them employment in the digital economy. What’s more, Sama is an anti-ghost work company. Each of its employees is hired ethically and receives fair compensation and benefits. \n\nFor over 10 years, Sama has partnered with leading global brands. Their stellar commercial performance has been achieved as they continue to scale opportunities for underserved individuals through the digital economy. Sama was one of the first AI companies to become B-Corp certified and has helped over 56,000 people lift themselves out of poverty. Its training and employment program was recently validated by an MIT-led Randomized Controlled Trial, confirming the effectiveness of its impact sourcing model by demonstrating that individuals that received both training and inclusion in Sama’s hiring pool exhibited lower unemployment rates and higher average monthly earnings.\n\n\"Sama’s openness to evaluate the impact of their programs with the rigor of a randomized control trial was refreshing and shows that they’re a leader in the movement toward ethical practices within the AI industry.\"\n-David Atkin, Professor of Economics, MIT\n\nMyth #2: Diversity is a pipeline problem\n\nWe have all seen the data in one shape or form: white men get the lion’s share of investor funding. Despite the movements calling for diversity, women-led startups account for just 2.2% (https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard) of the $150 billion invested in companies by VCs annually. Many have argued that the lack of diversity is caused by a pipeline problem, that there simply are not enough qualified investment opportunities – especially as it regards tech businesses. With the Series B raise, Sama paves the way for busting the myth once and for all. \n\nSama is a female-founded and led tech company that is deploying an impact sourcing model creating opportunities for marginalized communities, with over half of Sama agents intentionally being women. Founded by late Laila Janah and now led by CEO Wendy Gonzalez, the company has achieved responsible hyper-growth, and consequently, for the second year, a spot on the Inc. 5000 list as one of America’s fastest-growing private companies. The data speaks for itself.\n\nSama’s Series B raise represents the largest round for a female-led AI infrastructure in history. The round is led by CDPQ’s Equity253 fund that targets companies that leverage diversity and inclusion as a vector of development. The fund is put in motion because studies clearly validate that diversity in companies fosters better decision-making and has a positive impact on innovation, risk management, productivity, and financial performance. \n\n\"At the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION the rationale for investing in diversity is also clear – not only for profit and for purpose, but also to ensure structural change through the positive ripple effects that transcends generations. Sama embodies such rationale by improving employment and income for those with the greatest barriers to work and changing the narrative for their dependents\"\n- Anne Cathrine Garde, Investment Manager and Head of Scaleups.\n\nMyth #3: Impact does not fit the venture capital model\n\nSama was started as a non-profit organization because no one believed it could ever be a business. When late-founder Laila Janah pitched venture capitalists on Sandy Hill Road, the impact sourcing model was disregarded as it did not fit the typical parameters of hyper-growth and capital efficiency. On the opposite side of the spectrum, grant givers did not believe that impact sourcing could meet the basic needs of the marginalized communities. Sama proved both groups wrong. The company was ahead of its time, but luckily the landscape has changed a lot since then, and with the Series B raise, Sama is showcasing that impact is fit for staged financing.\n\n\n\nSince 2015, with Wendy Gonzalez on board, the company has focused on building a repeatable and scalable business model. From 2016 and onwards, Sama sustained itself on earned revenues and became a profitable nonprofit. With the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION investment in 2017, the Kenyan subsidiary was transformed from a non-profit to a for-profit company.\n\nJannek Hagen, Managing Director was a part of the team driving the investment decision:\n\n\"We invested in Sama Kenya back in 2017 as the first investor. Since then, we have witnessed how the team has transformed from a not-for-profit to a full-fledged, for-profit AI technology company\".\n\nThe investment set the precedent for Sama at group level to be transformed into a for-profit to attract further financing, talent, and expertise the following year. In 2019, Sama completed their USD 14.8M Series A funding with venture capital Ridge Ventures leading the round supported by Social Impact Ventures, Bluecrest Limited Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and BESTSELLER FOUNDATION.\n\nToday, Sama has taken the next step in its journey with the Series B raise that will take its purpose and profitability to new scales. In 2021, the landscape of impact investing looks different with the proliferation of many asset classes that are embracing an impact lens, covering the whole investment lifecycle. The time for launching an impact business is ripe and a big recognition goes to founders like Leila Janah, who ahead of her time proved the viability of purpose-driven businesses.\n\nLet us bust more myths together, one by one!\n\nHow are you busting the myths of impact? In a Sub-Saharan African context, where Sama and the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION have a strong presence, the journey towards impact equilibrium is twofold. Let us jointly normalize the concept of purpose-driven businesses while highlighting and measuring the impact that is happening on the ground. Our goal is to continue to ensure that impact is not diluted or misrepresented but used as a competitive advantage.\n\n**This post was jointly authored by Anne Cathrine Garde, BESTSELLER FOUNDATION and Amanda Durepos, Sama.**\n\n---\n\nAbout BESTSELLER FOUNDATION: We support entrepreneurs and invest in businesses that work for supporting the wellbeing of our natural world, for creating better jobs and opportunity, for sustainable growth.

Since Day 1, we’ve been committed to building technology that has a positive impact — across industries, but also across the globe.\n\nThis is no small task, and we’ve been busy since announcing our Series A funding in 2019. \n\nWe have opened offices in Kampala, Uganda, and Montreal, and Samasource became Sama. We were honored to win the 2020 AI Breakthrough Award for Best Image Processing Solution and this year were included in lists such as Forbes AI 50, Inc. 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies, 2021 AITechAward in Machine Learning Platforms category, and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas.\n\n\n\n\nSama became one of the first AI companies to receive B Corp Certification and was recognized on the Best for the World™ 2021 list for BLabs Workers category. Our training and employment programs continue to help individuals lift themselves out of poverty — 56,000 individuals to date — with our 3-year Randomized Control Trial by MIT validating our long-term impact on employment rates and earnings.\n\n\n\n\nUp to now, we’ve annotated over 1B image points on our platform (an average of 1M tasks completed per month) for industry-leading companies by the likes of Google, Walmart, and NVIDIA. And we did all this while achieving up to 99.9% data accuracy for our clients, versus an industry average of 94%.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n\nWorking with these exceptional clients for over a decade has highlighted an enormous area of opportunity, both for the future of Sama and for the AI industry as a whole. Enterprise AI teams have adopted a growing number of niche tools to support their end-to-end AI development cycle, and a lot of time (and accuracy) is lost building the infrastructure and pipeline required to integrate it all.\n\nAt Sama, we believe there’s an opportunity to bridge this gap, and to do so responsibly.\n\nToday, I’m thrilled to share that we’ve raised $70M of Series B funding to build the first end-to-end AI platform that enables teams to manage the complete AI lifecycle from start to finish.

Thank you to our clients for entrusting us with delivering the high-quality data you need to fuel innovation. And an immense thanks to the Sama team and community for years of hard work, heart, and dedication.\n\nThank you — each and every one of you — for being part of this journey with us. We wouldn’t be where we are today without you.

From our social-impact business model and training programs that help individuals lift themselves out of poverty to partnerships with the organizations creating change across industries, we’ve always believed in accurate AI’s ability to change our world for the better.\n\n\n\nThat’s why we’re honored to announce today that we’ve been recognized in Fast Company’s first-ever list of the Next Big Things in Tech for our work with our partners at Orbisk.\n\n\n\nHighlighting the new technological breakthroughs that promise to help define the future of the industries they serve, Next Big Things In Tech finds the products, services, features, research, and other technology efforts having a positive impact on consumers, businesses, or society at large in the next five years.\n\n“The climate crisis is growing increasingly dire each day. Right now, between 8-10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are the direct result of food waste,” said Wendy Gonzalez, CEO at Sama. “As we work to find ways to be more environmentally conscious, we were inspired by the team at Orbisk’s vision for the future of food service. Together, we’re incredibly proud of the solution we’ve built and its impact in minimizing waste production.”\n\nEach year, 931 million tonnes of food end up in landfills, and of that, nearly 362 million tonnes come from the foodservice and retail industries. With Sama’s high-quality training data powering its algorithm, Orbisk’s fully automated food waste monitor allows hotels, restaurants, and cafés to reduce food waste by up to 70%. \n\nOrbisk’s solution works by scanning plates of food to detect and record what items are being thrown away automatically and their quantities. With this data, businesses can make smarter choices that help save money while reducing food waste. To ensure accuracy, Sama successfully labeled hundreds of thousands of images of food, rapidly iterating to reach consistent attribute tagging. This allows Orbisk to improve accuracy and build a robust product capable of accurately recognizing food of all kinds in all steps of the cooking process.\n\nTo date, our partnership has enabled businesses to reduce an average of 8,000lbs of food waste per year. In total, prototyping projects alone have saved over 220,400lbs to date, and we’re aiming to reach over 220,000,000lbs saved annually by 2025.\n\n“Fast Company is thrilled to highlight cutting-edge technologies that are solving real-world problems in unexpected ways. From climate change and public health crises to machine learning and security, these technologies will certainly have a profound impact on the future, and we’re honored to bring attention to them today,” says Stephanie Mehta, editor-in-chief of Fast Company.\n\nTogether, we look forward to helping reduce the rate of climate warming by mitigating food waste.\n\nLearn more about our partnership and its success here, or check out the full list of Fast Company's Next Big Things in Tech here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fast-company-next-best-things-tech-2021"},"tags":[{"label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"label":"Awards","value":"Awards"}],"title":"Orbisk’s Sama-Powered Food Waste Solution Named to Fast Company’s First-Ever List of the Next Big Things in Tech"},{"_createdAt":"2021-08-17T19:01:34Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.
