If you have a passing interest or are just looking for a refresher in all things Machine Learning, we have put together a list of 10 books. Although published at varying points in the development of Deep Learning and Machine Learning, each book offers unique insights. It was near impossible to narrow the list to just ten, but we couldn’t look past those below.\n\n\n1. Grokking Deep Learning\nAndrew W Trask (2009)\n\nGrokking Deep Learning is suggested to be a perfect place to delve into the subset of Machine Learning, not only describing and explaining APIs and frameworks, but also talking the reader through how they can actually build algorithms from scratch. This hands-on style of writing will help you build an AI capable of beating you in a classic game of Atari and Neural Networks capable of understanding basic images. While this is not a beginners guide, experience with calculus is not required, merely a high school level of mathematical understanding.\n\n2. The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\nAndriy Burkov (2019)\n\nAn all you need to know guide to Machine Learning in just 100 pages, what more could you need? The Director of Data Science at Gartner, Andriy, suggests that you are a mere read of this book away from being ready to build complex AI systems, pass an interview or start your own business. Also available on Kindle, the 2019 release covers gradient descent, cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction and more. Is it for you? Andriy suggests that it is suitable for those both working in the field and those dipping their toe to find out more about the increasingly complex field of Machine Learning.\n\n\n3. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists\nSarah Guido & Andreas C. Mueller (2016)\n\nAlthough released in 2016, this 400 word bible for Machine Learning gives a great grounding in the basics of ML, providing a thorough and hands-on approach to Python use in ML. Learn not only what the most important concepts and algorithms are, but also when and how to use them. Imperative topics including machine learning workflow: data preprocessing and working with data are covered, as well as training algorithms, evaluating results, and implementing those algorithms into a production-level system\n\n\n4. Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction\nOliver Theobold (2017)\n\nA curveball, maybe, as we realize that those reading this list may have experience in the field, however, Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners walks through ML history and works in plain english with no coding experience necessary. What exactly will you be learning? The very basics including, decision trees, regression analysis, data reduction, k-means and more, giving you a great underlying understanding of the building blocks used in Machine Learning and how they can be used. Finally, some career advice with Oliver talking you through career options and how best to utilize the ML knowledge just picked up post-read.\n\n\n5. Mathematics for Machine Learning\nMarc Peter Deisenroth (2020)\n\nThis textbook puts the normally disparate course style of teaching in Mathematics to shame, combining together all of the fundamental mathematical tools needed to understand machine learning, including linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, optimization, probability and statistics. These concepts are then used to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines, giving a brilliant starting point for those entering the field and those looking for a refresher. Alongside the textual information, this book also includes examples and tests to ensure the reader's understanding.\n\n\n6. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\nChristopher M. Bishop (2007)\n\nChristopher Bishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. The first of its kind on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint, uses graphical models to describe probability distributions, which at the time, was not evident in any other ML text. Unlike some of the other inclusions on this list, familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential.\n\n\n7. Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques\nDaphne Koller & Nir Friedman (2009)\n\nA general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions. This book isn’t for beginners, nor for the faint of heart as it dives right into probabilistic graphical models in detail, including Bayesian and Markov Networks, inference, and learning from complete / incomplete data. If you want to get the most out of this book, there’s an option to attend Daphne Koller’s lectures on Probabilistic Graphical Models at Stanford University, on Coursera. Fun fact, Koller is actually one of the founders of Coursera, an online education platform.\n\n\n8. Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective (Net Developers)\nSergios Theodoridis (2015)\n\nThe book builds carefully from the basic classical methods to the most recent trends of the time, including chapters on pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as short courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models. All of the major techniques you’ll need to know prior to working in the field are covered, including Mean/Least-Squares regression and filtering, Kalman filtering, stochastic approximation and online learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, logistic regression and boosting methods. Alongside all of the theoretical text, this book includes case studies, code to be experimented with and more.\n\n\n9. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\nKevin P. Murphy & Francis Bach (2012)\n\nKevin describes this text as a comprehensive introduction to machine learning methods that use probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. This overview text combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Alongside this, the software platforms used in examples are freely available online. Unlike some of the other texts in this list, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective is suitable for upper-level undergraduates, giving an ideal introduction to ML and Mathematical formulas.\n\n\n10. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\nAurelien Geron (2019)\n\nIn the last few years, breakthroughs in Deep Learning have boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. Through minimal use of theory and maximum practical examples, this text helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With regular examples throughout, it’s a great book to not only grasp how and why it all works, but to also test it yourself.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-must-read-machine-learning-books"},"tags":[{"_key":"R9BEAeeH","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"OUl8Z7DG","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"10 Must-Read Machine Learning Books"},{"_createdAt":"2020-11-18T19:05:07Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

While it’s important to recognize that AI is still very much in its infancy in regard to large-scale change, there have been incremental advancements in recent years, which have somewhat gone under the radar for those not regularly perusing the latest AI news or working in said fields. To explore just how prevalent AI is in our everyday lives, we have collected five spaces in which AI is shaping consumer behavior and practices.\n\n1. Netflix\nThe entire catalogue of movies and shows at Netflix is ranked, customized and ordered for each individual user in a personalized manner using Machine Learning (yes, you can blame your roommate for messing up the algorithms and data). Through the use of Machine Learning, Netflix is able to forecast, and facilitate your next series binge with five key stages to their recommendation model: ranking & layout, similarities, evidence and search, model improvement and exploit learning. In short, Netflix uses customer engagement to find similarities and patterns in your watching data, alongside the categories you most often visit and even the artwork to which you’re drawn to. These hypotheses are then A/B tested for accuracy and developed to enhance user experience.\n\n2. Virtual Assistants\nOk, so this may seem like an obvious inclusion on this list, but many often don’t realize what it is that really helps to power Siri, Cortana and their industry colleagues. The seemingly simple command to action transaction is not as simple as it seems, with mere short sentences going through a variety of processes including recognition of wake words, speech processing, natural language understanding, text-to-speech and more. Many will remember that the initial virtual assistant offerings would often have many misspelled words, as well as an inability to understand the message and the obvious struggles with accents. However, projections for virtual assistants suggest that the already 20% voice search KPI on phones is set to increase, alongside adoption of VA into greater devices including cars and wearables. With the gradual implementation of VA into personal devices, it’s easy to overlook how far they have actually come!\n\n3. Online Shopping\nAI being used in e-commerce and online shopping is suggested to reach revenues of over $30 billion by 2025, which poses the question: how is it being implemented? Well, prediction of customer behavior is a crucial aspect of its success, auto-populating websites through algorithms made up of history, third party data, content data and other information to offer the necessary reference to the user. Alongside these examples, AI is also being used in the collection of data from consumers, listening to feedback, automation of review emails and product suggestions for retargeting. Alongside personalization and product recommendation, e-commerce retailers are now utilizing chatbots to provide 24/7 assistance, made possible through the development of self-learning capabilities and NLP. Interested in reading more? Check out our E-Commerce Guide.\n\n4. Education\nThere have been many early applications of AI in education, including, but not limited to grading, plagiarism detection, personalization and more. Recent developments in Machine Learning have seen companies like Gradescope using AI to develop assisted grouping techniques of handwritten answers from students. These groupings work on a points-based rubric allowing for accurate marking in seconds, which in-turn, can free up time for teachers and allows for greater lesson planning time, to name but a few benefits. Current AI algorithms are also being used to assist in the fight against plagiarism. Tools including Turnitin are using AI to locate copied sentences, structuring and other stylometrics alongside monitoring the creation and moderation dates of work. The future of AI in education, according to many, lies in the development of heavily tailored courses and classes for students with specific needs, which may not be as far off as you’d think with education startups receiving over 20 billion dollars worth of funding by the end of 2018.\n\n5. Ride Sharing\nRidesharing apps have been reported to use a variety of algorithms both for the benefit of the customers and organizations. It was only as recent as 2017 that Uber had admitted to adapting their pricing for rides based on customer data collected on socioeconomic factors of users. Seen as one of the first major adopters of AI, services like Uber have suggested that AI is central to almost every aspect of their business including fraud detection, risk assessment, safety processes, marketing spend and allocation, matching drivers and riders, route optimization and more. Ridesharing apps also use personal data in an anonymized and aggregated form to closely monitor which features of the service are used most. Through this, Uber and their competitors are able to analyze usage patterns and to determine where they should further focus developments.\n\nThese subtle implementations of AI across industries and in businesses may come as a surprise, but we have no doubt that over the next few years, AI adoption will not only become widespread, but increasingly publicized.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"ai-you-didnt-know-you-used"},"tags":[{"_key":"uZeu8hE2","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"oYVzsLww","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"5 Examples of AI You Didn't Know You Used"},{"_createdAt":"2020-07-17T18:31:06Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

We’re certainly betting on it: global spend on AI is predicted to be a whopping $98 Billion by 2023, up from 37.5 Billion in 2019. But we’re still in the early days when it comes to fulfilling the promise of AI and one of the reasons is training data—the annotated data a machine needs to learn to see or hear. Training data is essential to the development of any machine learning model. A global survey of Data Scientists, AI Experts and Stakeholders revealed that 8 out of 10 AI projects fail and 96% run into problems with data quality and labeling. \n\nEven applications now leading the scene have had their fair share of mishaps along the way. We’ve listed some examples of when AI might not have been performing at its best.\n\n\n\n1. The Somewhat Vulgar Virtual Assistant\n\nIt only took 24 hours for Tay, Microsoft's new conversational understanding chatbot, to start tweeting some extremely insensitive and offensive material online. The initial idea was to have Tay learn through ‘casual conversation’ with fellow Twitter users, which perhaps, at that time, was too far-fetched. While a majority of the 100k+ tweets were not considered to be eyebrow-raising, a selection of mimicking and extremely offensive posts saw Tay taken down after just one day. Unfortunately, the follow-up chatbot, ‘Zo’ resulted in the same fate, albeit after five months of live interaction.\n\n\n\n2. IBM Watson for Oncology\n\nMany see AI as the future of medicine, but it’s been suggested that IBMs Watson for Oncology initially over-promised and underdelivered with misdiagnosis, incorrect drug treatment offerings and unsafe judgement calls on patients. While there was and still is promise, the current ‘messy’ state of healthcare systems and mismatch between both the working and learning styles of doctors and machines became evident. Watson Oncology, however, continues to improve, with memory banks of every rare disease, increasing knowledge and a lack of cognitive bias potentially held by long serving medical professionals.\n\n\n\n3. Amazon AI Bias Recruitment\n\nNow scrapped, the once used AI recruiting tool from Amazon was found to be perpetuating the gender gap in tech jobs. The initial hope for a perfect filtration system for the top applications, was soon found to host significant bias towards hiring men due to being trained on resumes submitted in previous years—which were predominantly from male applicants. The use of historical data which facilitated existing bias has seen great advancements in regard to hiring diverse talent, but continues to have a long road ahead.\n\n\n\n4. Purchasing on Alexa\n\nResearch suggests that by 2023 over eight billion voice assistants will be present in consumers' lives. We predict many of these will be subject of, or susceptible to, some humorous moments while in development. We have seen doll houses ordered through ads on television (oops!), parrots casually chatting with Alexa, hacking issues, and all sorts. There is no doubt that the virtual assistant has further developed to a more accurate level since, but we’re excited for the future of viral YouTube videos to come.\n\n\n\n5. Insurance company uses social media data to issue rates, shows bias\n\nAdmiral Insurance, a popular company for first-time drivers, aimed to embed AI to analyse the Facebook data of those applying for insurance as they claimed there was a ‘proven link’ between personality and their driving style or ability. Facebook was quick to stop any advancements in this due to underlying ethical concerns, data privacy and potential bias of models.\n\nWhile AI carries a lot of promise, it also carries a lot of hype. When it comes to AI, your model is only as good as the data it’s trained on, because here applies: garbage in, garbage out.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-training-data-challenge-5-ai-fails"},"tags":[{"_key":"3firrVWY","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"93GN7laV","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"WeyhHs1O","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"The Training Data Challenge: 5 AI Fails"},{"_createdAt":"2019-12-20T02:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.
