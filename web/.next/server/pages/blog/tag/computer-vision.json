There’s also a rising demand for vision-guided robotic systems and application-specific computer vision systems, alongside a growing adoption of 3D computer vision.\n\n\n\nA Fundamental Problem with Computer Vision\n\nBhargav Desai, Technical Writer and Instructor at Eduonix shares that deep learning itself is arguably the most fundamental problem with computer vision. The emphasis on its strengths while lacking acknowledgement for apparent weaknesses such as mistaking an overturned school bus for a snowplow is not just a mistake but a revealing mistake.\n\n“It not only shows that deep learning systems can get confused, but that they are challenged in making a fundamental distinction known to all us humans, the distinction between “understanding” the object and “seeing” an object,” Desai explains.\n\nComputer Vision as Part of the Shopping Experience\n\nThere’s a growing demand among consumers for more robust search options including visual and voice search. A recent survey found that over 60% of respondents would be comfortable with new technologies like the ability to search by image as a part of their digital shopping experience.\n\nProjected Market Growth in Computer Vision Solutions\n\nThe market for computer vision solutions is expected to reach over 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2023, which is indicative of the growing pace of research and advancements in computer vision.\n\nThe Growing Application of Computer Vision Systems\n\nEnterprises like DHL are using extended reality experiences like AR to boost accuracy in their business operations. The company is using AR glasses to display picking and placement directions to its operators, and this application of computer vision systems has led to a 15 percent average increase in productivity.\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama quickly trains and validates machine learning, download our solution brief for details on our project set-up and workflows, platform security and annotation tools for computer vision.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"computer-vision-insights-from-around-the-web"},"tags":[{"_key":"gRBnMPo9","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"rxlxYiKX","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"kT5jCNe2","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"3o90fgFc","label":"Computer Vision","value":"Computer Vision"}],"title":"Computer Vision Insights From Around the Web"},{"_createdAt":"2019-06-28T21:59:52Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

As a service provider in this space, Sama has a unique view into the breadth of computer vision applications. While certain applications of machine learning are prevalent in mainstream media (e.g. autonomous vehicles), there are equally interesting and lesser-known applications that are similarly revolutionary:\n\n\n\n1. Environmental\n\nSatellites orbiting the earth have been collecting comprehensive image data sets of the globe for decades. With recent advancement in computer vision, these images can be efficiently and automatically combed for valuable information. By applying deep learning models to sets of satellite imagery, companies like Orbital Insight can extract data on global surface water levels, informing communities, planners, and policymakers in making critical decisions about water resources.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 San Luis Reservoir.

Biomedical\n\nImage analysis in the medical field is a time-consuming process; using computer vision machine learning to automate portions of this analysis could help make the process more efficient and less costly for the general public. A bottleneck to progress in this field has been the lack of training data, which requires specialists to create (though there’s evidence that specialists can be substituted by pigeons!) and the data is typically confidential. The availability of large datasets with diagnostic labels, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), has paved the way for new applications, using computer vision machine learning to provide early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\n3.Agricultural\n\nThe advancement of drone and computer vision technology has both lowered the cost of gathering huge sets of aerial imagery, and also increased our ability to intelligently extract information from that imagery. These technologies together can help farmers identify crop diseases or predict crop yields, automating a process where the alternative was manual inspection. In collaboration with Paul Allen towards his Great Elephant Census project, Sama facilitated the creation of a computer vision machine learning model used to track and count elephants as a part of anti-poaching efforts.\n\n\n\nElephant Sanctuary in Kenya, Sama, 2016\n\nUltimately applications of computer vision machine learning are limited only by human imagination. We look forward to seeing what applications this evolving technology will create, and are thrilled to count ourselves as part of this thriving community.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the future of practical computer vision, please join us at the Embedded Vision Summit, being held in Santa Clara from May 1-3. It’s the preeminent event for anyone adding computer vision capabilities to their products. We’ll be participating in the Vision Technology Showcase and invite you to stop by our booth.\n\nThe event is designed to inspire you to use vision technology in new ways and to empower you with the practical know-how you need to integrate vision capabilities into your products. Over three days and four tracks, you’ll meet innovators, luminaries, and colleagues in this fast-growing field.\n\nSama Sales team at Embedded Vision Summit, 2016","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"3-computer-vision-applications-you-havent-heard-of-yet"},"tags":[{"_key":"zGqHljfi","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"QcKBgjbl","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"mpmDlNYK","label":"Computer Vision","value":"Computer Vision"}],"title":"3 Computer Vision Applications You Haven't Heard Of...Yet"}],"morePosts":[],"slug":"computer-vision","tagName":"Computer Vision","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true}
