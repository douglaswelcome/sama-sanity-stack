And as more organizations develop their own AI and ML programs, the necessity of superior quality data is even more pertinent.\n\nImpact of Biased Data in Computer Vision\n\nAI bias can creep in at any stage of the training data lifecycle, and bias presents itself most commonly in three categories: dataset bias, training bias and algorithmic bias.\n\nDataset bias is as you might expect—the data does not provide enough information for the model to learn the problem, or it’s unrepresentative of reality in some way. Training bias is the result of poor quality or inconsistent data labeling, and lastly, algorithmic bias occurs when the algorithm itself makes poor predictions or produces poor results.\n\nModels trained on biased data not only produce inaccurate algorithms, they also present ethical, legal and safety problems. And in some cases, biased data in computer vision can perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender.\n\nLeft unchecked, algorithms trained on biased data greatly impact the lives of people using the very technologies meant to enhance their everyday experiences.\n\n\n\nCountering Bias in Training Data\n\nCountering bias in training data starts by having an effective training data strategy.\n\nLast year at Embedded Vision Summit, I presented a talk on practical training data strategies to avoid bias, sharing four ways to mitigate unwanted bias in training data. \n\nI want to echo my thoughts here that an effective training data strategy makes for a strong defense against AI bias. Fighting bias in training data means determining your data needs, developing training rules to cover known uses cases, and diversifying data to cover edge cases.\n\nAs your model learns, countering bias means evolving rules and sourcing more data when needed—all while keeping apprised of legal and ethical sourcing considerations.\n\nObtaining Superior Quality Datasets\n\nTop organizations understand that if they want smarter models, they need ethically sourced, quality data (https://www.samasource.com/quality-scale). Your quality requirements might vary, depending on your model, but the fact remains that diverse, high-quality data helps counter AI bias.\n\nFor over a decade, hundreds of organizations, including 25% of the Fortune 50 have relied on Samasource to deliver secure, high-quality training data and model validation for machine learning.\n\nWe’ve helped organizations like Walmart improve their retail item coverage, and others like Vulcan Inc., improve turnaround time to process training datasets. We’ve even partnered with organizations like Cornell Tech to produce an open-source dataset of our own. \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when sourcing superior quality datasets:\n\nBe aware of local privacy and property laws as you collect data.\n\nEnsure you have legal user consent for data capture.\n\nStay informed of the security protocols of facilities processing your training data.\n\nWhen possible, stay informed of the working conditions of the workers labeling your data, and support that pay living wages and benefits.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Samasource securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech, and if your goal is to build smarter AI, contact our team to discuss your training data needs. ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fighting-ai-bias-by-obtaining-high-quality-training-data"},"tags":[{"_key":"JOSMV7ei","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"X1b43vej","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"zoYY0bth","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"8v2jDpFA","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"Fighting AI Bias by Obtaining High-Quality Training Data"},{"_createdAt":"2019-08-27T16:55:52Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

Audrey Boguchwal, Senior Product Manager at Sama shares four practical approaches to training data strategy that can help AI teams avoid the effects of training data bias. \n\n\n\nThe Impact of Biased Data\n\n\nModels trained on biased data can be less accurate, resulting in insufficient training for your algorithm. Recent studies have shown that biased data can result in problems with facial recognition used in identification, surveillance, and law enforcement. Biased data can also perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender. \n\nEnsuring that reality is always represented in your data is a constructive way to minimize the impact of data bias, however, a clear training data strategy to legally and ethically source the data AI requires is fundamental for developing smarter models.\n\n\n\nAvoid Data Bias with a Practical Training Data Strategy\n\nClearly articulate your end training goal and know what data is needed to get to it. When you start with the end goal in mind, you're primed to think through the skill set, tool set and milestones needed to achieve your training goal. For example, for object classifiers, your training data strategy might include preprocessing data to capture bias or offset dataset bias. You recognize that images may look similar before you begin data collection and make a plan to consider transformations i.e. flip or automatically crop images so they vary.\n\nMap out ways bias can enter data and proactively source data to avoid it. Keep in mind that humans are inherently biased, so eliminating all forms of bias is near impossible. Rigorously examine your own biases and the biases of those providing data/information to you.\n\nAvoid selection bias by varying search terms and data sources, and avoid negative set bias by varying data i.e. collect data that contains background scenes in addition to objects of interest. Test before and after training, on a wide range of data. If in the end, you find your model to be of low variance and high bias, use cross-validation to influence the degree of flexibility of your model. Methods like cross dataset generalization can also help determine how reliant your model is on the \"native\" dataset, when compared to other representative datasets.\n\nEnsure data represents reality for your training goal in quantity and diversity, and replenish data often. High-tech, automotive, retail-- there isn't a single industry adopting AI that shows signs of stagnating growth. Refresh data often to stay ahead of trends. Use more than one training set, especially if it's a stock set. Success comes from being iterative, source and label new data as the world changes.\n\nAn effective training data strategy can help you determine ways to mitigate unwanted bias. Audrey Boguchwal, Senior Product Manager at Sama will present \"Practical Approaches to Training Data Strategy: Bias, Legal and Ethical Considerations this year at the 2019 Embedded Vision Summit conference.\n\nAudrey's presentation will expand on the four strategies to avoid training data bias in this post by exploring use-cases that show how unintended bias can creep into datasets, sharing tests to detect dataset bias, and outlining legal and ethical data sourcing considerations.\n\nIf you'll be attending Embedded Vision Summit, stop by booth #621 to discuss your training data needs with the Sama team, or click below to request a demo of our cloud-based data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-training-data-strategies-to-avoid-bias"},"tags":[{"_key":"79xbZuT2","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"hX284VAD","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"VrBfZ9C5","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"4 Training Data Strategies to Avoid Bias"}],"morePosts":[],"slug":"ai-bias","tagName":"AI Bias","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true}
