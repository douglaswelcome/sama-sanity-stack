And with 80% of AI project time being spent training the large volume of data necessary to train a model, efficiency improvements early on in the process are sure to have compounding effects.\n\nAt Sama, we have a dedicated Machine Learning team working at the forefront of AI research to identify optimization opportunities just like this, so we can develop advanced annotation tools to smooth the path to production for our clients. One of the papers the team presented at last year’s CVPR—Human-Centric Efficiency Improvements in Image Annotation for Autonomous Driving—shared an approach to speeding up polygonal instance segmentation using ML.\n\nToday, this technology has been incorporated into our platform to make our clients’ labeling process more efficient.\n\nWe call it ML Assisted Annotation powered by our MICROMODEL technology, and it’s already helping clients predictably get higher quality training data in half the time.\n\nRead on for an overview of ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology how it can help you develop models that are more scalable, robust and accurate – and can be brought into production more quickly.\n\nWhat is ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology?\n\n\nML Assisted Annotation (MAA) powered by MICROMODEL technology is an architecture that allows Sama to expedite the labeling process by drawing from a library of models trained on specific use cases. MAA can be used to generate high-quality pre-labeled annotations, which annotators validate to help them continuously improve over time.\n\nThis powerful combination of skilled annotators and an AI-powered platform allows us to deliver a high standard of label quality to our customers every time, along with efficiency improvements and quicker time to market.\n\nHow it works\n\nIn order to understand how MAA works, we first need to discuss the DEXTR model. DEXTR, or “Deep Extreme Cut,” is a publicly available object segmentation model for images and videos. \n\n\n\nWe’ve outlined the DEXTR model and our approach in detail in this post.\n\n\n\nMany ML methods like DEXTR have been suggested to speed up the process of instance segmentation, but these are not typically tested in a high-scale production environment, nor are ML outputs easily edited by human annotators. This makes it difficult to confidently reach the label quality standards required to run a model in production.\n\nMAA combines the well-known DEXTR approach with a raster-to-polygon algorithm to make results easily editable by a human in the loop. We’ve found that this approach—which pairs skilled annotators with ML-powered automation—significantly increases labeling efficiency and quality.\n\nLet’s see what that looks like in practice, using an example from the Autonomous Vehicle industry.\n\nMachine-Assisted Polygon Annotation\n\n\n\nWhen an annotator logs into the Sama annotation platform, they are presented with this workspace. In this example, the workspace is customized to allow the annotator to draw instance segmentation polygons around each of these vehicles:\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that there are several vehicles in this image. In a manual context, it could take a human several hours to deliver high-quality annotations of every single vehicle:\n\nWhat the manual annotation process would look like (sped up significantly): several clicks are required to draw a polygon around each of the vehicles.\n\n\n\nThis process is significantly accelerated with Machine-Assisted Polygon Annotation.\n\nThe model allows the annotator to use a crosshair tool to identify only four extreme points: left, right, top and bottom boundaries. These four clicks are the only inputs needed to create a heat map that is then sent to the inference server, returning an accurate prediction of a raster mask.\n\n\n\nWith Machine-Assisted Polygon Annotation, annotators only need to perform four clicks to produce an accurate raster mask prediction.\n\n\n\nMachine-Assisted Polygon Editing\n\n\n\nA polygon prediction can then be further refined by an annotator by switching into editing mode. This enables annotators to label precisely and ensure that high-quality requirements are met without compromise.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the raster mask prediction is edited by the annotator to ensure precise and high-quality labels.\n\n\n\nThis mode also enables annotators to use more than four extreme points in order to produce even more accurate predictions. A fifth user input point can easily be added, with the model immediately incorporating the new input to update its prediction.\n\nIf an ML model struggles to identify specific shapes, annotators can add a few more inference points to help result in a more accurate prediction, and then refine that prediction manually to ensure high-quality labels.\n\nResults from ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology\n\n\nOur clients are already seeing impressive results from MAA powered by MICROMODEL technology:\n\nPredictably producing 94-98% IOU (Intersection over Union) accuracy\nBecause our models are pre-trained on specific use cases for better performance out of the gate, our clients are seeing a quicker time to accuracy.\n\n2-4x more efficient annotation process\nYou can clearly see above that using MAA over a more manual polygon labeling approach results in significant time savings. But it’s also an iterative process with a human annotator in the loop; modifications to the predictions get fed back into the training data pipeline to retrain the model, enabling it to perform better predictions over time.\n\n\nQuicker time to market\nThe end result for our clients is faster iterations and a quicker time to market. A more efficient annotation process results in more data returned quickly, and ultimately a significantly shorter path to production.\n\nWhat’s more: increasing the efficiency of this labor-intensive manual data annotation process reduces the barrier to entry for more ML teams... and not just those with large R&D budgets. Technology like this can also help democratize data labeling by driving down cost, so we can see even more deserving companies leverage AI to drive value for their business.\n\nSmall teams who are getting started with labeling may not have yet defined what type of annotations they need, or how much data they need to be successful. MAA can help them iterate more quickly, developing models in short increments rather than in large, cumbersome workstreams. The end result is a quicker time to value, and ultimately, to market — for organizations of all shapes and sizes.\n\nLearn more about ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology by watching our recent webinar here, or reading more about it here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"ml-assisted-annotation-micromodels"},"tags":[{"_key":"giPx682h","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"JOgmW0AV","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"45fExC0n","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"ML Assisted Annotation Powered by MicroModels"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-22T23:06:59Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

But succeeding in a field as nascent as AI requires more than just bright minds and an ambitious roadmap.\n\n\n\nA key ingredient to success – and one that is often overlooked – is a mindset of experimentation; a culture that encourages teams to solve issues in new and more efficient ways. Early on, we found that our teams thrive in this kind of environment, which is why this week, we’re wrapping up our third Innovation Week. \n\nThe concept is simple: for one week, anyone can work on a project they feel passionate about. During the week, you have free rein to work on whatever you please in whichever way you choose. There are no meetings and no interruptions. You are free to try new things, invent and learn. You can be part of a team or single-handedly run with your ideas.\n\nThis year, some exciting highlights include:\n\nA more efficient approach to video tracking and segmentation\n\nNew Smart Polygon tool that is able to greatly increase annotation efficiency\n\nEnhancing our platform through the introduction of a Sama CLI and data pre-processing capabilities\n\nThe atmosphere is incredible. The week starts with a kickoff, where everyone can present the problem they are trying to solve and how they are planning to solve it. The closing ceremony is called the “Grand Reveal,” where each individual or group demos what they worked on. It sometimes yields incredible presentations... other times, it doesn't.\n\nFreedom breeds creativity. These events have brought some of the most core and innovative components of our platform. Last year, over 50% of all Innovation Week projects were incorporated into our roadmap and implemented within the following two quarters. A perfect example of this is our MicroModel technology, which was initially borne from one of these projects. We now use this technology for Machine Assisted Annotation for deployments in the automotive and e-commerce industries.\n\nNot only does the event enhance our product, it also attracts talent. This year, we doubled our R&D team and are continuing to grow.\n\nInnovation Week gives our R&D team the space to do what they do best: observe, experiment and discover.\n\nInnovation Week is coming to a close, and once more, our teams have given us plenty to be excited about. As always, many of the projects are slated to appear on our platform. In particular, we saw lots of work around our new 3D LiDAR annotation automation and data processing… stay tuned for that.\n\nAt Sama, Innovation Week is designed to encourage experimentation by allowing teams to shift the focus from our immediate customer’s needs to a broader, more bold approach to Machine Learning. If that sounds fun to you, consider checking out the open roles on our R&D team here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"innovation-week-2021"},"tags":[{"_key":"DWf2I8xz","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"TUfn4bAi","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"imL766wL","label":"AI Practitioners","value":"AI Practitioners"}],"title":"Innovation Week: How Sama Builds a Culture of Experimentation"},{"_createdAt":"2019-08-20T21:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.
