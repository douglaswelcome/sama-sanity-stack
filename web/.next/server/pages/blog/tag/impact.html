This marks the transition from solidifying product-market fit to truly taking the business and impact to scale.\n\nOn the road to Series B, Sama has received many recognitions for its innovative technology and impact sourcing model, including inclusion on the Forbes AI 50 and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas lists.\n\nThat said, getting to this milestone has not been straightforward. The team had to overcome the “valley of death” and bust many myths along the way. One by one. A few of them are highlighted below, cementing the viability of purpose-driven companies and hopefully inspiring others to bust myths on their path to purpose and profitability.\n\nMyth #1: Impact requires a trade-off between purpose and profit\n\nAlthough impact investing has become more mainstream over the past decade, the notion that there is a trade-off between impact and financial return is still very much alive — despite academic evidence pointing to the opposite. While purpose-driven companies may integrate impact in their business models in different ways, Sama’s Series B raise solidifies the fact that there is no trade-off between purpose and profit as you grow, when impact is inherent to your value proposition and product. \n\nThe company partners with big corporations—Google, NVIDIA, Walmart—to provide them with quality data to train their machine learning models. Sama provides high-quality annotated text, images, and videos for a range of use-cases, powering robot-assisted surgery, autonomous vehicles, personalized online shopping experiences, and more. Sama hires over 90% of its workforce from low-income backgrounds and marginalized populations in Kenya and Uganda, training them and granting them employment in the digital economy. What’s more, Sama is an anti-ghost work company. Each of its employees is hired ethically and receives fair compensation and benefits. \n\nFor over 10 years, Sama has partnered with leading global brands. Their stellar commercial performance has been achieved as they continue to scale opportunities for underserved individuals through the digital economy. Sama was one of the first AI companies to become B-Corp certified and has helped over 56,000 people lift themselves out of poverty. Its training and employment program was recently validated by an MIT-led Randomized Controlled Trial, confirming the effectiveness of its impact sourcing model by demonstrating that individuals that received both training and inclusion in Sama’s hiring pool exhibited lower unemployment rates and higher average monthly earnings.\n\n\"Sama’s openness to evaluate the impact of their programs with the rigor of a randomized control trial was refreshing and shows that they’re a leader in the movement toward ethical practices within the AI industry.\"\n-David Atkin, Professor of Economics, MIT\n\nMyth #2: Diversity is a pipeline problem\n\nWe have all seen the data in one shape or form: white men get the lion’s share of investor funding. Despite the movements calling for diversity, women-led startups account for just 2.2% (https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard) of the $150 billion invested in companies by VCs annually. Many have argued that the lack of diversity is caused by a pipeline problem, that there simply are not enough qualified investment opportunities – especially as it regards tech businesses. With the Series B raise, Sama paves the way for busting the myth once and for all. \n\nSama is a female-founded and led tech company that is deploying an impact sourcing model creating opportunities for marginalized communities, with over half of Sama agents intentionally being women. Founded by late Laila Janah and now led by CEO Wendy Gonzalez, the company has achieved responsible hyper-growth, and consequently, for the second year, a spot on the Inc. 5000 list as one of America’s fastest-growing private companies. The data speaks for itself.\n\nSama’s Series B raise represents the largest round for a female-led AI infrastructure in history. The round is led by CDPQ’s Equity253 fund that targets companies that leverage diversity and inclusion as a vector of development. The fund is put in motion because studies clearly validate that diversity in companies fosters better decision-making and has a positive impact on innovation, risk management, productivity, and financial performance. \n\n\"At the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION the rationale for investing in diversity is also clear – not only for profit and for purpose, but also to ensure structural change through the positive ripple effects that transcends generations. Sama embodies such rationale by improving employment and income for those with the greatest barriers to work and changing the narrative for their dependents\"\n- Anne Cathrine Garde, Investment Manager and Head of Scaleups.\n\nMyth #3: Impact does not fit the venture capital model\n\nSama was started as a non-profit organization because no one believed it could ever be a business. When late-founder Laila Janah pitched venture capitalists on Sandy Hill Road, the impact sourcing model was disregarded as it did not fit the typical parameters of hyper-growth and capital efficiency. On the opposite side of the spectrum, grant givers did not believe that impact sourcing could meet the basic needs of the marginalized communities. Sama proved both groups wrong. The company was ahead of its time, but luckily the landscape has changed a lot since then, and with the Series B raise, Sama is showcasing that impact is fit for staged financing.\n\n\n\nSince 2015, with Wendy Gonzalez on board, the company has focused on building a repeatable and scalable business model. From 2016 and onwards, Sama sustained itself on earned revenues and became a profitable nonprofit. With the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION investment in 2017, the Kenyan subsidiary was transformed from a non-profit to a for-profit company.\n\nJannek Hagen, Managing Director was a part of the team driving the investment decision:\n\n\"We invested in Sama Kenya back in 2017 as the first investor. Since then, we have witnessed how the team has transformed from a not-for-profit to a full-fledged, for-profit AI technology company\".\n\nThe investment set the precedent for Sama at group level to be transformed into a for-profit to attract further financing, talent, and expertise the following year. In 2019, Sama completed their USD 14.8M Series A funding with venture capital Ridge Ventures leading the round supported by Social Impact Ventures, Bluecrest Limited Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and BESTSELLER FOUNDATION.\n\nToday, Sama has taken the next step in its journey with the Series B raise that will take its purpose and profitability to new scales. In 2021, the landscape of impact investing looks different with the proliferation of many asset classes that are embracing an impact lens, covering the whole investment lifecycle. The time for launching an impact business is ripe and a big recognition goes to founders like Leila Janah, who ahead of her time proved the viability of purpose-driven businesses.\n\nLet us bust more myths together, one by one!\n\nHow are you busting the myths of impact? In a Sub-Saharan African context, where Sama and the BESTSELLER FOUNDATION have a strong presence, the journey towards impact equilibrium is twofold. Let us jointly normalize the concept of purpose-driven businesses while highlighting and measuring the impact that is happening on the ground. Our goal is to continue to ensure that impact is not diluted or misrepresented but used as a competitive advantage.\n\n**This post was jointly authored by Anne Cathrine Garde, BESTSELLER FOUNDATION and Amanda Durepos, Sama.**\n\n---\n\nAbout BESTSELLER FOUNDATION: We support entrepreneurs and invest in businesses that work for supporting the wellbeing of our natural world, for creating better jobs and opportunity, for sustainable growth.

Decisions around building a robust data pipeline are among the most fundamental.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right data partner will obviously impact how well a model performs. If we look a bit deeper, we also find that this choice has a real impact on the well-being of the whole data supply chain workforce. Sometimes collectively referred to as data enrichment professionals, all workers involved in the data supply chain—from labelers to quality analysts—are affected by an organization’s data procurement decisions. \n\nThe complexity of the data procurement process combined with a lack of standards around equitable data supply chains has several downstream implications for these essential but largely unseen workers. Despite their foundational role, working conditions for data enrichment professions can be precarious: they can face wage uncertainty, low pay and limited career growth opportunities.\n\nYour data enrichment choices have a direct impact on workers’ well-being\n\nThere is, however, an opportunity to make a difference. The decisions organizations make while procuring data labeling services can have a meaningful impact on the working conditions of data enrichment professionals.\n\nPartnership on AI (PAI) is a multistakeholder organization that brings together academics, researchers, civil society organizations, companies building and using AI technology, and other groups working to better understand AI's lasting impacts. Their latest white paper Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services examines the working conditions of data enrichment professionals, and seeks to:\n\nCritically evaluate the impact of the industry’s current practices on workers;\n\nExplore practices the industry can adopt to improve worker well-being; and\n\nAdvance the discourse around the future of data enrichment work and the indispensable role it plays in AI development.\n\nThe paper gives AI practitioners and decision makers visibility into the impact of their decisions in procuring data enrichment services – from selecting providers, to running pilots, to conducting quality assurance and more.\n\nRead the full white paper: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services\n\nSince data labeling is a key part of this equation, it was important for Sama to partner with PAI: to both share our lessons learned from several years of striving for more ethical supply chains, and to continue to learn from industry peers about responsible AI.\n\nIn fall of 2020, Sama participated in the five-week series of Responsible Sourcing workshops held by PAI, the output of which was a set of strategic recommendations for this white paper. The workshops brought together more than 30 professionals from different areas of the data enrichment ecosystem including representatives from data enrichment providers, researchers and product managers at AI companies, and leaders of civil society and labor organizations. \n\nTo fully understand the impact of AI on society, one must examine the bias and shortcomings of models, but also the means by which they are created.\n\nWhile more work and research is needed, Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services shares actionable insight that practitioners can use as a starting point to raise important conversations with internal stakeholders. Our hope is that these conversations will be a step in the right direction: toward giving data enrichment professionals better recognition for the critical role they play in building AI. \n\nRead the full white paper: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services\n\n\n","seo_title":"New White Paper by Partnership on AI: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"partnership-on-ai-whitepaper"},"tags":[{"_key":"pwpeoY5O","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"Sf3M02mD","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"New White Paper by Partnership on AI: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services"},{"_createdAt":"2021-06-17T19:32:29Z","author":{"_id":"e8a1f3c6-0b07-4638-93d5-61a0924f32e3","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-2f8efc599a377bd580d0ae12f022a15e7e1acacd-632x676-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Amanda is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama, where each day she gets to learn about AI and how it’s transforming industry.

Clean, curated, labeled, ready-to-plug-into-your-models data. But it’s not always so easy to get your hands on a dataset that you can use to quickly and efficiently push your models into production. That’s why the individuals who focus on data labeling are so important, and why Sama is making huge efforts to cultivate the next generation of AI specialists.\n\n\nRather than sourcing from the world’s top universities or boot camps, Sama has spent several years delivering a course entitled Artificial Intelligence 101 to individuals in Kibera, the largest slum in Africa. This course teaches students the basics of AI work, simultaneously training AI talent and taking aim at systemic poverty.\n\nTo discuss the results of these efforts, Sama’s CEO Wendy Gonzalez joined our podcast, How AI Happens. Wendy explains:\n\n🖥️ Why providing work is a more impactful approach to ending poverty than providing aid;\n\n🎓 How Sama’s program has measurably improved women’s income and employment rate by 60%;\n\n✏️ How data labeling skills provide talent with access to employment in AI and beyond.\n\n\n\nStream the full episode below, and if you’d like to see the nuts and bolts of how Sama’s mission has affected the community, be sure to check out MIT’s recent RCT study measuring the impact of AI education on student employability and income.\n\n\n(audio embed)\n\n\n\nAnd don’t forget to subscribe to How AI Happens on your favorite podcast streaming platform!\n\n\n\nTranscript:\n\n\n0:00:00.0 Wendy Gonzalez: Talent is distributed equally, but opportunity is not. And the best way to solve poverty, which is basically the root cause for every major social ill in the world, is by giving work, not giving aid.\n\n0:00:16.8 Rob Stevenson: Welcome to How AI Happens, a podcast where experts explain their work at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. You'll hear from AI researchers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers as they get technical about the most exciting developments in their field and the challenges they're facing along the way. I'm your host, Rob Stevenson, and we are about to learn how AI happens.\n\n0:00:48.1 Rob: Today on How AI Happens, we're going to talk about the next generation of AI specialists. While this might bring to mind the image of a starry-eyed Stanford PhD or a youthful self-taught prodigy, I'm thinking of a different source of talent, because over the last several years, Sama has been delivering a training program entitled Artificial Intelligence 101 to eager individuals in Kibera, the largest slum in Africa, just outside Nairobi, Kenya. To learn more about how an AI company can train technical talent while simultaneously taking aim at systemic poverty, I sat down with Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama.\n\n0:01:29.5 Wendy: I have, I'm a little embarrassed to say, over 25 years of experience [chuckle] in enterprise technology and SaaS and AI. I started my career in management consulting, really helping large companies figure out how to leverage technology. I switched over to the enterprise side, working to really implement disruptive technologies. And then I co-founded an Internet of Things startup about a decade back to build a SaaS platform, because again, IoT was a way to really disrupt the industry, and then I switched over to AI. So I joined Sama in 2015, and Sama is the leading trainee data as a service platform. We work with the Global 2000 to really help enable their mission-critical AI applications.\n\n0:02:13.1 Wendy: I was really compelled to join Sama because I believe deeply in Sama's mission, and really, our philosophy that Sama was founded on is that talent is distributed equally, but opportunity is not. And the best way to solve poverty, which is basically the root cause for every major social ill in the world is by giving work, not giving aid. Over a trillion dollars' worth of aid has been donated to sub-Saharan Africa since the 1960s, yet, GDP hasn't changed. While it seems like the right thing to do, the best thing that we can do to really solve the problem of poverty is by providing financial independence, and that's through giving work. And so, Sama's mission of purposely hiring people in underserved communities to give work was something that really spoke to me, because as a child of immigrants and marrying my husband who was the first person in his entire family through all generations to go to school, the power of work is transformative in terms of lifting up your community and lifting up the people in your family.\n\n0:03:11.4 Wendy: So that mission spoke very, very deeply to me. Sama had a really unique and audacious view on this, which is, it's not just about kind of paying living wages and providing employment and benefits; it's about purposely hiring people who've got the greatest barriers to employment. And so, Sama's model is to hire, in underserved communities, 50% women, 50% youth who have household incomes of less than $2 a day, which is the World Bank standard for poverty. And so I was fascinated with this idea of taking purposeful action and change to hire people and not just sort of provide wages, but really provide a transformative career path to hopefully break the poverty cycle permanently.\n\n0:03:52.1 Rob: This notion of giving work rather than aid has taken the form of Sama's Digital Basics Program, that's the AI 101 course I mentioned earlier. As Wendy explains, this training is the first step in removing the barriers to access between eager, underserved workers and well, work.\n\n0:04:12.8 Wendy: One of the challenges is not just about, \"Hey, I'm in this situation, I didn't graduate from a fancy school or college,\" it's also by just having access to the network to get jobs. So I say barriers to employment, it's not just kind of education and where I live, but it's like, \"Do I know the right people, how do we even get connected to a job?\" So the Sama Digital Basics Program really started by working with community partners in underserved communities, I'll give you an example in Nairobi, to where we work with partners like the Human Needs project that has a facility that is embedded in the Kibera slum, which is the largest slum sub-Saharan Africa. So, it was an idea to bring digital skills training into communities, so that, again, to provide and reduce that barrier to access.\n\n0:04:57.7 Wendy: And so what the Digital Basics Program does is it provides everything from basic skills like mounting and keyboards, but also the basics of AI. So what is artificial intelligence, what role does training data play in empowering artificial intelligence applications, and it's really the initial training that is necessary for somebody to come and join the Sama program.\n\n0:05:20.2 Rob: It should be pointed out here that the goal of the Digital Basics Program isn't merely to create a farm team of future Sami employees, though many of them do wind up working there; rather, the skills that go along with data labeling end up providing individuals with a much wider breadth of opportunity.\n\n0:05:38.4 Wendy: It's not just about building training for the purpose of, \"Okay, now you can do data labeling,\" what we found, if they're doing this program 'cause we were actually launched in 2008, is that the skills necessary to do labeling and tagging are critical thinking skills that actually apply to many different jobs on a go-forward basis. Our intention was always not just hiring people into Sama and you'll be with Sama for the rest of your lives; it was really about building the skills that allow our workers to go on to higher-paying jobs, return to university. That's the entire idea of when I say permanently breaking the poverty cycle, is to build the foundation so that people can move on to higher-paying jobs.\n\n0:06:16.1 Wendy: So while we have a pathway, of course, to move up within Sama, the other objective of this is to build a core set of technical skills. So the training typically occurs within community or at our offices, and then of the people who are trained, some go on and move on to other jobs, many come and apply at Sama. After doing this level of training, we would hire people in as employees, so we're different, we are not freelancing, we are not crowdsourcing. A part of our mission is to provide living wages, benefits, and professional development that'll allow people to further their careers. And so they get hired into Sama, and typically, they will do data labeling as an entry point. And so data labeling, just to take us back a little bit in terms of artificial intelligence, is that...\n\n0:07:03.7 Wendy: You think about it this way, AI is as intelligent as the trainee data it's built on, because machine learning is all about recognizing patterns, then using deep learning techniques for the application to make decisions. Put another way, before a car can drive itself, like a self-driving car, it needs to be able to detect roads, pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs, and training data is basically structuring the data so that a computer vision application can identify, what is a car, what's a drivable space, what's a road sign, et cetera. And while that sounds like it's relatively simple, it's actually incredibly, incredibly complex. Some of these data labeling activities include data labeling in 3D. I don't know if you've ever seen radar or light or images, it's very, very complex. And then beyond that, it's not just about detecting and after being that information correctly; it's about the precision of it. And so, tagging a car is not just tagging a car, sometimes you need to include the side-view mirrors, maybe you need to include the shadow under the car, maybe you do need to include what's behind the car, maybe you don't.\n\n0:08:05.3 Wendy: So there's actually quite a bit of complexity, and so, in terms of the types of work and the skills that are being built, you have to tie it back to a taxonomy, there could be business rules. So, a part of what's being developed as critical thinking skills as well.\n\n0:08:22.9 Rob: As I mentioned before, this program has been underway for years, so, this podcast episode isn't meant to be an audio press release. The reason I wanted to bring Wendy on to discuss the program is because of a recent study measuring the effects of these efforts, a six-year randomized control trial conducted by MIT and Innovations for Poverty Action, a research and policy nonprofit promoting effective solutions to global poverty. Wendy explained some findings from the report, and whether those findings were in line with initial goals.\n\n0:08:55.4 Wendy: The thing that we are really trying to understand or MIT was trying to understand is this purposeful hiring model that this part of Sama's mission, that's core to the way that we operate, is that intervention of purposely hiring somebody from an underserved community, does that actually improve their employability and their income rates in the long term? Does it actually break the poverty cycle that I was talking about before, or would these people just would have succeeded anyways?\n\n0:09:18.5 Wendy: So when we talk about really, how do you measure that, it's called a counterfactual study, which, when friends ask, \"Well, what do you mean? What is an RCT? Why did you do this study\", it's kind of like, the FDA does it for drug approvals, right? Somebody takes a placebo, somebody takes the medicine, and then you find out at the end, well, did the medicine really work? And so that's really what we're trying to do here. Did this purposeful intervention of hiring, did it make a difference in somebody's employability and growth and income?\n\n0:09:46.0 Wendy: The study wasn't just a matter of, \"Hey, let's take some surveys.\" It's actually even something in the works for six years. So we plan for a year, a year and a half, to identify folks and create a very detailed study, three years of actually surveying people on a regular basis. So, fun fact, over 2000-plus hours of surveying time [chuckle] and interviews and calls. But at the end of the day, the idea was to say, \"Did the intervention work? Is there a meaningful and material difference, and do we have all over the data over time to prove it?\" I believe all of our internal tracking that yes, we were, so it was amazing to get that ratified, that, yes, indeed, over the long term, this purposeful hiring model made a huge difference in terms of income and employment levels. But in particular for women, that was the thing that was really exciting to learn, and that was a little bit surprising, is that Sama's model has been to create a purposeful higher model of 50% women and 50% youth.\n\n0:10:48.0 Wendy: And we focused there from a mission perspective, because what I think has been well-researched and understood is that when women are lifted up in the economy and when women are lifted up in income, they contribute back to their communities, more kids go to school, there's a real network effect of investing in women. And so that was part of our purposeful hiring model, to where we have a criteria in hiring at least 50% women, which is a little bit unique, and again, purposeful. And what we found is that after this three-year time frame, there was a 60% improvement in employability and income rates for women who went through the Sama intervention versus who did not. And that was really exciting. Really, really exciting to see that that basically means that our hypothesis that women have barriers to entry and employment is indeed true, but that the purposeful hiring model at the beginning of their careers actually makes a difference in them not only having greater income but continuing to stay employed.\n\n0:11:46.5 Rob: When you look at the impact these studies showed with women specifically, was that surprising or just delighting?\n\n0:11:54.7 Wendy: It was delighting. We did a lot of community surveys before launching this program, because let's not just assume we know what people need, that's the entire point of financial independence, let's hear from them what is needed, and what we found is that, in particular, it was just really challenging for women to get into the right networks, to get jobs. And so, this was the model between that and knowing that the impact that women can have when they are lifted up, but I think what was surprising is not just the income levels, but I think what surprised me was the employment levels. I mean, 60% is significant. So, yeah, I was delighted, [chuckle] to answer your question.\n\n0:12:34.3 Rob: Of course, the ability to do a job and the ability to get a job are vastly different skills. This was reflected in the report, as researchers found subjects who did not receive employment placement assistance had a much harder time finding work, even if they had the same technical training as others. So, does that mean mere up-skilling is not enough?\n\n0:12:57.2 Wendy: I think what that speaks to is that while training is incredibly important, that action, the purposeful hiring, is really kind of what moves the needle. I'm all for providing the training, and I think what we found is that what we're trying to do is, in addition to the core skills training, is gonna be, how do we help people match themselves to jobs, and there's some pretty incredible organizations out there who are specializing in this area, so we don't assume we've gotta figure it all out. [chuckle] We are working with partners to help us on things like the skills matching. But the key thing, you have to make those purposeful choices, so, oftentimes, I talk to our customers about the ethical AI supply chain, or really how you use impact criteria as part of how you make your buying decisions. And I think that's something that's incredibly important, because I know we're going to be a proof point and move tens of thousands and over time, hundreds of thousands, of people out of poverty, but imagine the world's biggest corporations are spending trillions of dollars in procurement. Imagine what they can do if they make those same purposeful hiring decisions. We can leave millions and tens of millions of people out of poverty.\n\n0:14:08.6 Wendy: We're doing this at Sama, but I would love for every company in the world to take the same approach, and if you're not in a position to make these purposeful hiring decisions, well, work with suppliers, use social impact criteria as part of how you make your buying decisions. So the more we can get this out there, that, \"Hey, the model works,\" makes a meaningful difference, it also has tremendous business benefits as well. What happens for us, we have incredible retention, and that has created more value in our AI platform. So there are many, many different reasons to take this approach, and from a social mission standpoint, we can build incredible technology, create incredible value from our products, and we can change lives at the same time.\n\n0:14:51.5 Rob: What do you foresee in terms of additional education beyond data labeling? When you look at further development for their up-skilling, do you foresee that being an offering over time?\n\n0:15:00.8 Wendy: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I love that you mentioned that. I hate to sound buzz wordy, if you will, but I mean, data is the new code. The skills that are being built here aren't just for, \"Okay, I can label\"; it's really about building not just those critical thinking skills, but the way that we move our workforce up the value chain is that they are building analytical skills. So gone are the days where our workforce would come in and be like, \"Oh, is there a dog in this picture?\" or something like that. They're doing way more sophisticated work, doing everything from training machine learning models and driving very sophisticated training data sets, to evaluating and quality sharing training data sets that have been produced by automation, all the way to identifying what's missing, do we have a representative and complete data set? So it's really about moving from labeling and taxonomies and workflows to analytics and beyond. So, yeah, there's a lot of exciting work ahead, and beyond the analytics and management, yes, data science, that is the next frontier.\n\n0:16:08.7 Rob: If data science is the next frontier, then any company seriously deploying it has an awesome responsibility, not just to make a great product, but to utilize this technological position to up-skill the next generation of talent, and do so in such a way that ensures representative, more diverse, more creative future for our industry.\n\n0:16:31.6 Wendy: Next time on How AI Happens:\n\n0:16:38.5 Speaker 3: There's a pretty substantial rules-based expert system that sits on top of this to help manage some of the downsides of the inherent biases we have in the data.\n\n0:16:53.0 Wendy: How AI happens is brought to you by Sama. Sama provides accurate data for ambitious AI, specializing in image, video, and sensor data annotation and validation for machine learning algorithms in industries such as transportation, retail, e-commerce, media, med tech, robotics, and agriculture.

Here are their findings.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"I am excited to announce that this week, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) released a white paper evaluating our impact through a 3-year Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study. On the heels of this achievement, I am reminded of Leila Janah, my dear friend and the late founder of Sama.\n\n\n\nLeila’s dream was to conduct an RCT, often referred to as the “gold standard” in research. An RCT is an independent study, in which a third party validates the impact of your social model. We had long known we were creating impact through our own data collection, however, in 2016, we had reached a point where we wanted to have it validated.\n\nThis led to a joint effort with researchers at MIT, and with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), to launch a study from 2017 to 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness of our training and employment programs in creating sustainable pathways out of poverty in Nairobi, Kenya. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive training through Sama (Group 1), or receive training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or receive neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\n(See IPA’s project summary for an easily digestible explanation of the impact evaluation.)\n\nOver the course of the three-year study, individuals reported their employment status, earnings, and the industry they worked in. They also shared insights about their current and future outlook on aspects ranging from community engagement to health to life satisfaction. The main finding of the study is that individuals who were trained by and had the chance to work at Sama (Group 2) were more likely to experience better outcomes than other groups. By the end of the study, average earnings for individuals in Group 2 were almost 40% higher than those in the Control Group, and unemployment rates were 10% lower. Training and the opportunity to work at Sama had an even greater impact on women. Average earnings for women in Group 2 were 60% higher than women in the Control Group.\n\nThe findings reinforce what our internal research has long shown: that our impact hiring model has a positive and meaningful effect on long-term employment rates and earnings. To have MIT validate our model proves that business can be a force for social good. And while it takes conviction to run a purposeful hiring model, we are driving an ethical supply chain that meaningfully improves employment and income outcomes for those with the greatest barriers to work.\n\nIt is my hope that these findings will contribute to larger sustainable development discussions across the public and private sector and in particular will drive corporations who spent trillions each year on their supply chain to utilize impact criteria as part of their decision-making process. Think of the impact we can drive then.\n\nRead the Paper: Evaluating Sama’s Training and Job Programs in Nairobi, Kenya\n\n\n\nAuthors:\nDavid Atkin (MIT) \nAntoinette Schoar (MIT Sloan) \nKiara Wahnschafft (MIT)\n\nRead More Key Stats from the RCT","seo_title":"RCT Results from MIT: Evaluating the Impact of SamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Training and Job Programs","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"rct-results-mit"},"tags":[{"_key":"X2bQOmTh","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"RCT Results from MIT: Evaluating the Impact of SamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Training and Job Programs"},{"_createdAt":"2020-09-24T16:19:34Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

In the next breath, she talked about dominating the training data industry and catapulting Sama to claim its much-earned spot in the AI landscape.\n\nThis introduction was just the first of many conversations we would later have on the importance of sustainability, impact, and responsible hyper-growth.\n\nI’m deeply humbled and honored to announce that, as of today, Sama is among the first AI companies to receive the prestigious B Corp certification. The achievement comes on the heels of completing our three-year Randomized Control Trial (RCT), which demonstrated the actualized impact of our hybrid model and continued commitment to fusing purpose and profit, both internally and externally.\n\n\n\n“This achievement is the result of years of hard work and dedication from our entire Sama community. By securing B Corp certification and completing our RCT, we’re not only carrying Leila’s passion and commitment to impact, but we’re making a tremendous stride within the AI industry,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “I’d like to extend immense thanks to everyone who played a part in making Leila’s dream a reality.”\n\n\n\nB Corp certification is a measurement certified by B Lab, a non-profit company that measures a company’s social and environmental performance. We received a score of 98.5, excelling in the ‘Workers' and 'Community Impact' criteria, and placing us well above the 80 points necessary to achieve B Corporation status. Of the 3,500+ Certified B Corporations, Sama is the first and only AI company recognized and joins companies such as WeTransfer, Patagonia, Hootsuite, and Ben \u0026 Jerry’s, all who use business as a force for good.\n\nThree years ago, Leila kicked off what would become a rigorous journey towards completing a full RCT. This in-depth trial, often referred to as the \"gold standard\" in research, evaluated our training and employment effectiveness towards our mission of creating a sustainable pathway out of poverty. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive either training through Sama (Group 1), training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\nOne of the trial’s main findings is that individuals who are trained and employed by Sama make higher levels of employment and earnings (Group 2). This study and subsequent completion of the RCT further validated the training programs we’ve created at Sama, an impact model that has helped 50,000 people lift themselves out of poverty, increased wages by 4x, and provided over 11,000 hours of training. \n\nBecoming B Corp certified and completing an RCT in tandem is a direct example of how our team at Sama is leveraging AI to address critical societal issues. This year has proved that making a real impact and having a mission-driven business model is what truly matters in driving the bottom line. We believe that receiving B Corp certification should be the new metric companies strive for in today’s day and age. It’s not just about chasing after unicorn status anymore, it’s about creating a successful company while creating meaningful change. \n\nWe’ve accomplished our goals in large part as a result of our supportive community, but it doesn’t stop here. We’re looking forward to continuing our commitment to making a lasting impact on the world and improving the lives of as many as possible.\n\nDue to our hardworking team and our supportive investors, friends and family, we’ve been able to follow through on the vision and legacy created by our founder, Leila Janah.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Sama team, thanks for taking this journey with us.","seo_title":"From Dreams to Reality: Our Journey to Becoming a Certified B Corporation","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"we-are-a-b-corp"},"tags":[{"_key":"hZTYAcKb","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"DDJ2bEmS","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"oKWZS5Lg","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"AuzJCOHb","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"From Dreams to Reality: Our Journey to Becoming a Certified B Corporation"},{"_createdAt":"2020-04-22T23:33:05Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

In addition to spearheading our impact model, she sparked a deep love of nature in the visitors to our East African offices by increasing their exposure to African nature and wildlife.

Mid last year, we officially launched our sustainability program.

She always wanted to lead by example, to show the world how business could be both profitable and a force for good.\n\nWhat better way to do this than provide the ultimate success story and demonstrate that a technology company can be committed to both providing the leading training data platform and to using business as a force for good?\n\n“One of the things I’m proudest of at Sama is our collaboration with conservation groups including the Nature Conservancy to use AI to track endangered species, combat poaching, and protect wilderness. Not only that, but we do it by employing women (more than 50% of our workforce!) from low-income backgrounds, which itself is a way to fight climate change.” - Leila Janah\n\n\n\nI’m thrilled that Sama is actively engaged with B Lab and is in the final stages of audit verification for our B Corporation certification.

There’s also someone guiding AI strategy, developing the tech to support AI pipelines, and so on.\n\nData annotation is a key part of making machine learning possible, and conversations around ethical AI supply chains are vital to have now if we want to ensure the labeling industry is a positive force.\n\nAccording to our baseline impact survey data, prior to joining Sama, female workers in our global delivery centers earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, despite having comparable educational backgrounds.\n\nWe found that gender discrimination—especially in the technology sector—and the challenge of being a primary family caretaker make it difficult for many women to get into and stay in the formal employment sector in Kenya and Uganda.\n\nWomen are highly driven and eager to align their education with real-world opportunities, yet a recent report from the World Economic Forum found that if progress continues at its current rate, it would take roughly 95 years for sub-Saharan Africa to achieve gender parity.\n\nThis number is astonishing, but there is a path forward, and it involves equipping younger generations with the skills needed to succeed in the growing digital economy.\n\nAt Sama, our workers receive digital literacy training, as well as specialized training on artificial intelligence and our advanced training data platform. Also, in addition to connecting women and youth to dignified digital work, workers gain access to life and professional skills development opportunities, to further advance their careers.\n\nWhen women succeed, everyone benefits, and closing the gender gap at work is key to achieving at least five of the sustainable development goals set by the UN. In the last decade, Sama has positively impacted over 50,000 lives, and we’re proud to have achieved gender parity in our global work centers, by ensuring our workers earn equal pay for equal work. \n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about our impact, read our story here, or work with us on training data and model validation, to start making a positive global impact one bounding box at a time.","seo_title":"How Sama is Closing the Gender Pay Gap for Women in the AI Supply Chain","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-samasource-is-closing-the-gender-pay-gap-for-women-in-the-ai-supply-chain"},"tags":[{"_key":"daz4fDnC","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"wLYQCPhS","label":"Women in AI","value":"Women in AI"},{"_key":"EiPsNBnG","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"How Sama is Closing the Gender Pay Gap for Women in the AI Supply Chain"},{"_createdAt":"2020-02-28T21:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"b4d4d096-8187-41fa-a386-87ce949c9915","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-45005425be54d2d450b1aa53f7d9435477531eb3-1664x1758-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Liliosa is the Impact and Marketing Manager at Sama.","name":"Liliosa Mbirimi Muturi","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"liliosa-mbirimi-muturi"}},"estimatedReadingTime":6,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-7e68dc7b894694d301fe5feff694b3df88f8beda-2048x1365-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"meta_description":"As AI adoption expands, untapped communities are finding work at the cutting edge of AI. Here are 4 ways AI makes a positive impact on communities in East Africa.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"In a small town in Northern Uganda, Ocem turns on his lights at 6am to get ready for work. It’s his second year working at Sama, and before becoming an AI trainer, he was a student at the local university, moonlighting as a farmer.\n\nWorking in AI was not a path Ocem imagined until he was recruited to work at Sama. In fact, like many students, his greatest uncertainty was whether he could put his degree to good use at all, post graduation.\n\nOcem’s story is like many other young professionals in East Africa, but as AI adoption explodes, these talented, untapped communities are finding work they never thought possible, at the cutting edge of AI.\n\nHere are four ways AI makes a positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nGainful Employment\n\nA report by the World Bank shared that 60 percent of the unemployed in Africa are youth, who after graduating from University will take on average, one year to find employment in their field of study. \n\nI believe this is due to the lack of formal career opportunities within the region, making it difficult for the employment industry to support the volume of college graduates entering the workforce.\n\nAs a result, talented graduates find work in menial jobs that often don’t provide a sustainable income, but Sama and other tech companies are working to fix that.\n\nThe explosion of AI has birthed the demand for high-quality, ground truth data for artificial intelligence, and with training, recent graduates like Ocem can find meaningful work in the growing digital economy.\n\nDriven by a mission to expand opportunity for low-income people, Sama's social impact business model has helped over 50,000 people move themselves out of poverty through digital work.\n\nWorkers in our East Africa centers are paid a living wage and competitive benefits. They also receive ongoing digital skills training and have access to professional development opportunities that further help increase the purchasing power of their communities, potentially ending a long cycle of poverty.\n\nSkills and Knowledge\n\nAs more tech companies expand operations to Africa, and more people start gaining on-the-job experience working in machine learning and AI, the positive impact AI makes on communities in East Africa will only expand.\n\nI’ve personally witnessed how energized the youth in East Africa are about the intricacies of enriching data for AI. For many, this budding tech boom has motivated them to enroll in courses centered around data sciences and AI.\n\nAlso, the Deep Learning Indaba, an annual meeting for AI enthusiasts in Africa has brought together a growing number of youths for week long discussions, debates and research on machine learning and AI.\n\nWith a reliable IT infrastructure, paired with increased trust in the skill level of youth workers in the region, East Africa has the potential to become a major hub for AI training data.\n\nAt Sama, our AI training classes fill up weekly, and this level of investment in skills development for young professionals is what’s needed to continue developing the talent pool. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nUnesco reported that 30% of the tech-workforce in sub-Saharan Africa are women, and despite the challenges of gender discrimination in the technology sector, the percentage of female workers is steadily growing. \n\nWomen in Africa have often been set apart from the tech industry because culturally, they were considered primary caretakers, expected to focus on their family, not their career. Now, the vast opportunities in AI are helping to change that.\n\nWe actively recruit women and youth to work in our East Africa centers, providing in-depth technical training, so underserved communities can pursue a career in AI. From scholarship programs to nursing rooms, we’ve also made it a priority to establish an office culture conducive to the success of women workers.\n\nOur baseline survey data found that women earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, before joining Sama. By ensuring we achieve gender parity in pay, while simultaneously paying a living wage, our workers can support themselves and their families sustainably.\n\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nAs more populations in Africa adopt mobile technology and digital apps, their exposure to AI-enabled technologies that collect data to improve experiences will only increase. These interactions can be as simple as product recommendations from an online store, or interactions with an automated messenger bot.\n\nGiven the rapid advancement of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) , the Kenyan government recently passed a data protection law which complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nSimilar to GDPR, this legislation outlines restrictions on data handling and sharing, in an effort to regulate the processing of personal data and information in the country.\n\nThis commitment to increased digital security will no doubt have a positive impact on the citizens of Kenya, and in many ways, it sets the standard for data privacy and protection across the continent.\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute predicts that AI has the potential to deliver an additional economic output of $13 trillion by 2030. This economic growth, alongside the digital transformation of sub-Saharan Africa will have enormous positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama connects people to dignified digital work, you can read about our social business model here.","seo_title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-ways-ai-makes-a-positive-impact-on-communities-in-east-africa"},"tags":[{"_key":"AEPEpJXp","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"tc6Hsfbm","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"VmY4sBKG","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"iLYfly0n","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa"},{"_createdAt":"2019-07-01T21:45:00Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

This is how the car learns to be autonomous.\n\nThese humans creating training data for algorithms are the soul of AI.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a deep focus in measuring and managing environmental and social impacts of supply chains and implementing corporate impact programs. Carbon footprint and circular economy were part of my everyday lexicon.\n\nNow, staring into the eyes of our human workforce -- the real-life AI supply chain -- I started to think of the implications for supply chain ethics and sustainability.

But another key part is how partners think through the role that rigorous impact evaluations can play in achieving their learning goals.\n\nAn understated part of a successful RCT is the internal organizational buy-in that our implementation partners make to deliver their services in a way that complies with the design of a rigorous evaluation. I was able to catch up with Twisha Mehta from Sama, currently in the middle of an evaluation of their program in Kenya, to hear a partner’s perspective of the goals and challenges they met along the way.\n\nSama provides secure, high quality training data and validation for AI. They count the most prestigious technology firms as their clients and serve technology teams driving humanity forward. As an early adopter of Impact Sourcing, the core of the Sama business model is rooted in social impact. Their staff is driven by a mission to expand opportunity for low-income people through the digital economy.\n\nWhat is Sama, and what’s the program being evaluated?\n\nSama is a social business that provides training data strategy, annotation, and validation services to technology companies. We have global delivery centers in Uganda, Kenya, and India that provide language and computer vision data services for use in machine learning algorithms, such as those used in self-driving cars and virtual reality applications.\n\nOur business model is predicated on the idea that, when combined with the appropriate technology platform, we can effectively train a workforce comprised exclusively of workers from low income, low education backgrounds to deliver high quality digital services at market competitive quality and prices. This is the driving idea behind our Learning and Development (L\u0026D) training program. We recruit students to join 10 day bootcamps from low-income communities throughout Nairobi, Kamapla, and Gulu.\n\nUpon completing the training course, they are eligible to apply for jobs at our global delivery centers. For most trainees, this is the first formal job they’ve had. The curriculum covers basic digital skills, occupational skills relevant to AI work.\n\nThis RCT aims to understand the value of training as a stand-alone service along with the value of training in combination with the ability to apply for a job at our global delivery centers.\n\n(See IPA’s project summary for an easily digestible explanation of the impact evaluation)\n\nWhy was it the right time for a randomized evaluation? What do you hope to learn?\n\nAs a social business, we often face the dual challenge of generating social impact, while also balancing business needs of growth and scale. We’ve learned a lot along the way on how to do that effectively.\n\nMeasuring impact is important to us for a few reasons. First, we want to create more transparency about what we’ve learned. We want to change the mindset of private sector corporations that believe that you have to choose between social impact and profit. You can have both!\n\nWe’ve seen firsthand how transformative the power of a paycheck has been on the lives of the people who we hire. From that perspective we want to use this impact evaluation as a proof point.\n\nSecond, we’ve reached a stage of organizational maturity where we have unprecedented insights into our entire supply chain. Data is a core part of our DNA as we grow and scale- and we are committed to using it for continual learning. Operationally, this positions us to not only ask questions about our impact, but to make changes to our targeting and delivery model based on what we learn.\n\nCan you describe the process of running an RCT within a profitable business?\n\nInternally, we had support from the senior management team which recognized the business case for the RCT – we needed to undertake this study in order to prove the efficacy of our business model and prove that social businesses can thrive in the world (and back it up with rigorous impact data!).\n\nOperationally, the challenge was to deliver within the constraints of our demand driven business without compromising service quality. This meant getting buy-in from teams at the local level and working very closely with the local teams.\n\nWhat were the challenges?\n\nOur foremost concern was about our reputation and maintaining the trust we’ve built in the communities we operate in. It was very important to us to be forthright and transparent about the study process with the people we invited for our Learning and Development training boot camps.\n\nStill, it was a challenging shift for our trainers, who work closely with the communities we recruit from, to inform people that they were placed in the control group- and will not receive any training or opportunity to apply for jobs with Sama.\n\nTo mitigate any perceptions of unfairness, the team decided to run the randomization process with a physical lottery during the open enrollment periods. This helped interested students that were placed in the control group understand that it was simply the luck of the draw.\n\nThe second major challenge was to operationalize the research design. After all, our services are dependent on client demand and we can’t hire for new positions without securing work first. We worked closely with our various business units to forecast hiring based on client demand, then worked with the researchers to plan the research within those constraints.\n\nWhat’s next for this evaluation?\n\nAt Sama, we have a strong data driven culture across all of our business units. Data provides us with concrete evidence to pilot initiatives, understand their efficacy, and invest in ideas that work.\n\nThe RCT is a significant investment for our company. Good, bad, or ugly, we're going to share these results and learn from them. We know that we can use the results of this RCT to improve our training program to deepen our positive impact by creating more digital jobs.\n\nWhen we started, Sama was a seemingly far-fetched idea: Training and hiring marginalized East African youth to do digital work for some of the largest technology companies.\n\nHowever, several philanthropic funders including Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard Foundation took a chance on us and helped us test and scale our idea until we reached financial sustainability. Seven years after we started, we hit financial sustainability- an elusive north star for many start ups!\n\nNow, as we complete our tenth year as a company, we look forward to the RCT results to validate our impact, create new academic literature on our model, and most importantly, provide evidence to our early supporters that well thought-out out-of-the box ideas are worth investing in! (With impact data of course!)","seo_title":"Measuring Impact for a Social Enterprise","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"measuring-impact-for-a-social-business"},"tags":[{"_key":"fAZImpYg","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"i7FgIhg1","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"Measuring Impact for a Social Enterprise"},{"_createdAt":"2017-05-24T21:33:56Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

Now we’ll spotlight one of our clients to show how our image annotation work can be used in machine learning to train image recognition algorithms.\n\nMarkable came to Sama for help training their state-of-the-art image recognition technology that identifies fashion products in photos and videos. With Markable’s tech in place, viewers can click on clothing they see while watching TV shows and Markable will generate matching product results. Check out Markable’s demo to see how it works.\n\nTo create image recognition technology, engineers develop a machine learning program that learns to identify objects of interest from training data. For Markable, the training data is photographs of fashion products, clearly labeled so when the algorithm encounters an unknown product, it can infer what it is based on trained examples. This process is called “supervised learning” because the algorithm is given examples structured specifically for training. A high-quality training data set for a vision algorithm consists of tens of thousands of images in which objects are outlined and labeled according to the desired classification. The accuracy of the training data is important as an algorithm trained with inconsistently labeled data won’t learn patterns and won’t be able to identify objects.\n\nHow do all those training data images get labeled accurately and quickly enough to get Markable’s tech to customers? That’s where Sama comes in. As part of our image annotation service, we have a trained, scalable workforce and the right tools to label thousands of images for training data, efficiently and accurately. We balance stringent quality requirements with on-time deliveries to ensure clients like Markable can stick to their project timelines.\n\nSama worked closely with Markable to understand the project’s annotation requirements and refine them for ambiguous images. Markable provided Sama with source images and then we trained a dedicated team of workers how to draw boxes around the objects of interest and label them. For Markable, Sama workers learned to identify every minor visible detail, such as heel-length of a shoe, to ensure exceptional data quality. Sama’s on-site quality analysts inspect a sample of annotated images daily to ensure quality, asking workers to redo any images that don’t meet client standards.\n\nHere’s what image annotation work looks like in the Hub. Agents draw bounding boxes (or tight outlines) around each object and then use a menu to add labels. In the for-presentation-only image below, a worker has labeled the shirt, pants and is labeling boots with a multi-level menu. Sama can set up label data entry to meet a variety of project needs: text entry, selection from a dropdown, or search for a label from a list, to name a few.\n\nWith Sama’s workers, Markable has been able to improve their algorithm and better serve their customers. They wrote to us: “With the help of Sama's annotation, we were able to surpass previous state-of-the-art accuracy on the largest open-source fashion e-commerce dataset. We had a great experience in working with Sama and we will continue working with them in future.”\n\nSama’s client relationships are a win-win: clients provide our workers with life-changing job opportunities and workers help clients achieve their business goals, even on the trickiest projects.\n\nIn our third and final post, we’ll show you how Sama’s workers take on a web research project.","seo_title":"Better Algorithms, Better Lives: Reducing Poverty Through Training Data","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"better-algorithms-better-lives-reducing-poverty-through-training-data"},"tags":[{"_key":"Bx4Do9xK","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"Rx6gXgmn","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"iujrQUVj","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"v5mZqxPX","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"Better Algorithms, Better Lives: Reducing Poverty Through Training Data"}],"morePosts":[{"_createdAt":"2017-05-15T23:51:58Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

Sama is the linchpin in our model, as it allows our project managers, agents, and clients to access the work being done, while also allowing us to closely monitor quality and provide feedback for continuous improvements.\n\nAs a SaaS platform, the Hub can be accessed securely from anywhere - our San Francisco headquarters to our Sama Center in Nairobi, Kenya. To support the Hub, we have a full time, dedicated engineering team that help the Hub evolve to meet changing client needs and continuously improve worker efficiency.\n\nDuring our sales cycle, Sama meets with clients to better understand their data services needs. When a contract is in place, a project manager will partner with the client to design a Hub project workflow that satisfies project requirements, a quality strategy to check work, a training plan and a delivery schedule.\n\nOn Hub, project managers then upload data from clients that our workers will clean, use as the basis for research, annotate or supplement. Next, they custom-design the task layout and workflow that workers will see when they log in to complete tasks. From question types and dependency logic to an easy-to-read layout, the Hub can accommodate a range of project needs.\n\nOnce the project is set up, workers complete specialized training to learn the new workflow. Throughout training, workers are coached by on-site team leaders and evaluated by quality analysts until their work is at or above the client’s desired SLA for quality. The SLA is the service level agreement, that is, the level of quality agreed upon in the client’s contract with Sama. When training is complete, workers begin production tasks on the Hub. During production, coaching continues to maintain quality. QAs use the Hub to check task quality and send back tasks that are below quality standards for rework. Once work is completed, it can be downloaded from the Hub or delivered directly to the client via API.\n\nIn future posts, we’ll go in-depth in two case studies to see how Sama completes work for different verticals: web research and image annotation for machine learning and computer vision applications, and how the Hub is an integral part of our process.\n\nStay tuned!","seo_title":"How Samasource Moves People Out of Poverty with Digital Work","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-exactly-does-samasource-move-people-out-of-poverty"},"tags":[{"_key":"Z2i2Xm9p","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"NE08Dk4r","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"mwOWz5qA","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"How Samasource Moves People Out of Poverty with Digital Work"},{"_createdAt":"2016-01-26T21:48:00Z","author":{"_id":"037257b7-27fe-47e4-8b0b-7fc05f55fa6d","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-d3fb21c2ca35139da39b453c1981b5d04545ab51-800x800-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":null,"name":"Leila Janah","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"leila-janah"}},"estimatedReadingTime":6,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-37701649c15c883643f12a6b0a10ebb11dfdd4c3-5472x3648-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"meta_description":"Davos: It's Not Enough to do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"I spent last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos raising funds for Sama and building Laxmi’s global community of retailers and partners. Along the way I came across some especially powerful ideas, and reinforced one of our own (the impact bond).\n\nHere are five key tech and social impact trends from this year’s Forum:\n\n1. It’s not enough to do less bad. We say this a lot in the office — new businesses can’t define themselves by avoiding the bad (not polluting, not hiring slaves, not using toxic ingredients). The best emerging companies, and the savviest traditional/old brands, understand that creating positive social and environmental impact in the world is important to Millennial consumers. Corporate social responsibility is dead — it feels too weak. We want to see corporate activism on issues like climate change, human rights, and equal pay. It’s already happening. Richard Branson’s B Team hosted a lunch on this and entertained several ideas put forth by social entrepreneurs (including my friends Jeremy Heimans and Nancy Lublin). Chanel’s chief legal counsel said during a brilliant sustainable fashion session organized by Zara Ingilizian that in an era of rising inequality, “the only way luxury can exist is through total integrity.”\n\n\n\n2. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the way leaders will talk about tech. Professor Klaus Schwab, WEF’s Founder, wrote a new book and named the conference after this theme. The Fourth Industrial revolution refers to digital integration across every industry, from agriculture (think smart crop monitoring via drones) to mindfulness (Paul Davidson’s Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction program is now online) and non-profit work (Nancy Lublin’s Crisis Text Line is a great example). Schwab’s idea is that technology is a revolution as profound as the Enlightenment — what came before will not predict what comes afterwards. There are pros and cons to this shift — we will see rising global prosperity and access to basic goods and services, but we’ll also see economic shocks as more jobs are automated.\n\n\n\n3. Impact bonds and pay-for-outcomes models will dominate global social sector funding. It’s crazy that we spend billions on global development programs that may or may not lead to outcomes — instead, agencies fund programs and activities. We need a new way to fund the most important social sector work that gives organizations the freedom to innovate and spend as they see fit, so long as they deliver. The social impact bond has been tried in dozens of settings — to reduce recidivism, for example, in the UK and the US. How it works: non-profits with demonstrated outcomes commit to a certain target for a given sum — for example, 2,500 people moved out of poverty for $2.5M dollars over three years. Private investors put up the capital (a “security”) via an intermediary. If the non-profit hits the target, philanthropists pay back the investors with a return (usually 4–5%). Donors don’t pay unless the outcome is achieved, investors bear the risk, and non-profits have access to unrestricted capital. Sama is raising growth capital though an impact security — learn more here.\n\n\n\n4. “Stakeholder capitalism” is no longer niche; it’s mainstream. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff described Schwab’s early idea that stakeholders matter more than simply shareholders as formative. Salesforce’s 1–1–1 model (1% donation of product, profit, and employee volunteer time) was directly inspired by this thinking, as is much of the benefit corporation movement. “Stakeholder capitalism” shifts the focus of business from the narrow lens of short-term shareholder profit to a broad definition of profit that includes workers, customers, and the environment — a very important factor in how Millennials work, shop, and spend time. I think in time we will expand this idea to include “giving work” rather than donating capital — addressing poverty, recidivism, and a host of other social problems by incentivizing companies to hire from marginalized populations.\n\n\n\n5. Safe harbor provisions would allow tech platforms to innovate around labor. What does a job mean today, when 40% of US workers are “contingent labor” (read: contract workers)? 50% of Uber drivers work fewer than 10 hours a week. And what about Airbnb? The founders of these companies aren’t evil — they’re probably much more socially progressive than their Wall Street counterparts. So why not allow them to test things like contributions to retirement plans, better training, and the like without forcing these companies to risk massive lawsuits for being considered employers of record? This issue came up in discussions with US Senator Mark Warner and the Markle Initiative’s Zoe Baird, who are keen to propose legislation along these lines.\n\n\nMy personal favorite moment: running into Dr. Muhammad Yunus three times — twice in the cloakroom — and talking to him about #GiveWork, the core idea behind Sama. Yunus is a legend in the Sama office for his decades-long struggle to build microfinance into a movement (and the subject of my favorite Halloween costume). I had to pinch myself.","seo_title":"Davos: It's Not Enough to Do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"davos-its-not-enough-to-do-less-bad-5-tech-and-impact-trends"},"tags":[{"_key":"XcKmjphM","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"1tC6Pi0u","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"X3YfCf7h","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Davos: It's Not Enough to Do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)"}],"slug":"impact","tagName":"Impact","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/tag/[slug]","query":{"slug":"impact"},"buildId":"YWzTCZqh_Y7EMW0L5W93M","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
