MIT has defined ‘human-centered AI’ as “the design, development, and deployment of systems that learn from and collaborate with humans in a deep, meaningful way”. Therefore, to become less ‘human-centered’, you would need an AI landscape in which smart algorithms do all the heavy lifting. We asked experts working in the field about their thoughts on the role of humans in Machine Learning, and humans and the future of ML.\n\nRemo, Senior Software Engineer at Apple, states: “ML as a part of software engineering is by definition human-centric. It is human-centric because it substitutes the work of humans. For example in the recommendation of music, the identification of spam, or in object recognition. ML is human-centric because it is often (or almost always) trained on human generated or at least labeled data. And it is human-centric because ML models are built and designed on top of people's inductive biases about the world. At the same time it is not human (or human centric) because it does not reason or think. It spots patterns but does not \"connect the dots.\" \n\nIndu Khatri, the Machine Learning Lead at financial giant HSBC echoed the point above: “I would break down ML problems into three parts. The first one being identifying the problem to which ML needs to be applied and defining a broad architecture about how ML models will solve the problem. The second stage is developing the ML models and the third stage is taking actions based on ML models, getting the feedback from your environment and improving the models further. Out of these three stages, I believe Stage one will always need some kind of human intervention. With the advent of AutoML the amount of human intervention is decreasing everyday. Finally, for decreasing the amount of human intervention in Stage three we would need to improve the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning so that our Models can map predictions to actions in a feasible way.”\n\nConversely, Staff ML / NLP Research Scientist at Stanford and former Senior Research Scientist at Uber AI, Piero Molino, suggested that moving away from a human-centric model would be a mistake. “I believe there are several friction points that can be automated, like the data/model interface, the model search, evaluation and monitoring, Ops in general. But what I would rather wish is for ML to become more human-centric in the sense that it should put more humans at the center of its strategy rather than increased efficiency, and that is achieved with more humans in the loop evaluation and data generation processes, more robustness and more fairness evaluations.”\n\nData Scientist at Gartner, Lavi Nigam, thinks we’re already fairly close to an AutoML model, which as the name suggests, would mean far less human-interaction needed. So much so, that we could only be a few years away from this coming to fruition. “When more and more intrinsic pieces of data science workflows are automated mathematically and programmatically. We already see AutoML models that can figure out the best model for your data with any constraint defined. As the AutoML advances, we will eventually see that human interference in model building will greatly reduce and result in more optimized models. Deployment automation and Model Tracking (both part of MLOps) are other areas of focus where human involvement will drastically reduce in the coming years.”\n\nShuo Zhang, Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation, agreed that we’re fairly close to an ML model which requires little human interaction. “There are many current techniques that make ML algorithms less dependent on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large amounts of data, such as self supervision and unsupervised techniques.”\n\nTwo other experts we asked agreed that ML as a concept requires human intervention. Removing this wouldn’t be beneficial and could actually be the opposite. Jason Gauci, a Software Engineering Manager at Facebook stated that “ML should work hand-in-hand with people, not replace them or automate the things that they do without oversight.” This was somewhat echoed by Sean Xie, Director of AI at Pfizer: “Current technologies are still focused on solving narrowly defined and specific problems. There’s a long way to go to be less human-centric.”\n\nIf we were to move toward an AutoML/less human-centric model, how could it be done? Yaman Kumar, PhD Computer Science at the University of Buffalo suggested that you would need to “join forces with the philosophy, metaphysics and ethics department and see the field adopting human-centric vision right, left and centre. As long as both AI and philosophy departments are cutoff and work in their own silos, things will go on as-is. Recent times have shown green shoots where more and more people from philosophy backgrounds are entering the field and guiding key areas such as fairness in ML.”","seo_title":"Experts Explain: How to Think About Human-Centered Machine Learning","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-to-think-about-human-centered-machine-learning"},"tags":[{"_key":"pOB3rwcB","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"v412ROa8","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"Experts Explain: How to Think About Human-Centered Machine Learning"},{"_createdAt":"2021-03-29T21:29:09Z","author":{"_id":"785c9b8f-1869-4ce3-9eaa-c53945aa9736","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-c187f0a84bc4d1a6870d3a7a8528f242920a33aa-309x343-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Aurelie Drouet leads Product Marketing at Sama.

It's been predicted that 87% of AI projects will never make it into production. Why? We asked ML experts what they believe to be the main reasons that ML projects fail.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nA disconnect between the science and real-world application of the ML solutions and business expectations.\n\nUnreasonable expectations from business hierarchies on both the outcome and cost of many ML projects .\n\nAiming to develop MLOps without due diligence and research into some of the challenges that could be faced along the way .\n\nTo make an ML project successful, we need to find the right problem, use the right data, and develop the right method. Many ML projects do not meet these three requirements.\n\nIt’s not easy for companies to find enough data to run useful and high quality ML models.\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam\nData Scientist, Gartner\n\n“The biggest reason for project failure is ML processes maturity. There are too many moving and distinct pieces in ML/DL workflows and they are not mostly tied intrinsically by a single tool/framework. Enterprises and open source projects are trying to bridge this gap and I feel in the next 3 years we will see good progress in this area. Open source end-to-end MLOps are very important since they will help with wider adoption just like Tensorflow did for deep learning. Another big issue which increases project failure is that currently data science is evolving and has not reached ‘enterprise ready consensus’ with regards to set practices for different domains.”\n\n\n\nSparkle R. \nAssociate Director Data Science, Johnson & Johnson\n\n“ML projects still fail because of the disconnect between the science and real-world application of the ML solutions and business expectations. We are now in a society that prefers to use the word ML to demonstrate prestige despite having no clear impact. While there are many other reasons that can contribute to a ML project’s failure, the major factors include: a lack of high-quality data, poorly designed research questions, overly optimistic business expectations and a disconnect between the developers, product owners, data scientist and the ML-based system end users.”\n\n\n\nRemo Storni\nSenior Software Engineer, Apple\n\n“The biggest reason for ML project failures are unreasonable expectations about what is possible and unreasonable optimism about the project. People have trouble expecting the unexpected. There are a number of ML projects that fail and often these are problems that ML can't easily solve properly right now like conversational AI. There is a much bigger number of problems where ML falls short of expectations or where the project hits unexpected data or engineering problems.”\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal \nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n\n“I think this happens because people don’t do enough prep work before starting the project. It doesn’t make sense to apply a deep learning model where a logistic regression can do the trick. So, HOMEWORK before starting the project is very critical for the success of any ML project”.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\nStaff ML / NLP Research Scientist, Stanford University\n\n\"Because of the uncertainty baked in many parts of the machine learning development process. It is very difficult to assess beforehand if a machine learning project will succeed without analyzing the data, training initial models, evaluating them and then iterating. Product teams still don't know if there's enough signal in the data to begin with, how much data would they need, how expensive annotating it would be, and in many cases they don't have great ways to monitor and evaluate models. All these uncertainty sources, together with wrong expectations, may lead to failure of ML projects.\"\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh\nMachine Learning Lead, Apple\n\n“There are a variety of reasons ML projects fail. Sometimes ML projects are initiated without synergy on expectations, objectives, and success criteria of the project between the business and ML teams. There could be other reasons ranging from lack of expected data, expertise, limitations in the technology itself for certain domains. This is a long-term investment & hence clear strategy and leadership support are necessary for success.”\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\n\n“Many projects fail because people don't trade off the benefit of success with the consequence of failure. Imagine a smart garage door opener that could open your garage door in anticipation of your arrival. If it opens when you want, it saves a button press. But if it opens when you aren't around, someone can rob your house. Because of this extreme tradeoff, the model needs to be impossibly accurate because it's competing with a button press that is almost 100% accurate”\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\n\n“Most people just tried to find nails with an existing hammer. To make an ML project successful, we need to find the right problem, use the right data, and develop the right method. Many ML projects do not meet these three requirements. There is also miscommunication between the ML scientists and domain experts. It is not easy to find enough data to train the model. New methods need to be developed based only on the problem and available data.”\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri \nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n\n“Most ML projects fail because of a lack of understanding among the Business Executives about how ML models apply to their business. This usually leads to ML teams not solving the right problem for the business and underwhelming results. I have heard about projects that are stuck in research because of unclear problem statements.”\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\n\n“Projects failing in ML, in my opinion, is chiefly due to three reasons: under-specification, over-expectation and clean toy datasets. While most of our datasets are so clean that the models trained on them hardly work in the real conditions, the ones that do are marred by the hype surrounding AI and ML. Underspecification normally comes from a lack of maturity in the field.”","seo_title":"10 Experts on the Biggest Roadblocks to Bringing ML Models to Production","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-experts-biggest-roadblocks-ml-production"},"tags":[{"_key":"fLUi1ttd","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"1iCuMNwM","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"10 Experts on the Biggest Roadblocks to Bringing ML Models to Production"},{"_createdAt":"2021-02-09T20:20:36Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

It is widely accepted that without ample amounts of high-quality training data, the application of AI and Machine Learning is impossible. This has also been seen in studies, including an IDC survey, in which only 30% of companies reported a 90% or higher success rate in their AI rollout, with reported failure rates of 10 to 49 percent. A key reason for this? Data! \n\nWe partnered with our friends from RE•WORK to reach out to various ML experts, specifically asking them the questions: Why is high-quality training data so important? Why do so many projects fail in ML?\n\n\nManmeet Singh\nMachine Learning Lead, Apple\n\n\"The core of any Machine Learning model is what input is being fed to it as the model generalizes based on these training examples. The criteria to choose a ML model is heavily dependent on the kind of input available. For the model to learn anything relevant, training data plays a key role. Imagine in a supervised setting, we are trying to do object recognition. If the labels themselves are messed up what would the model learn? Besides the quality, the quantity of training examples also plays a major role. Training data forms the basis of business decisions based on the offline KPIs being measured on their information. They are the building block for defining a roadmap to the product cycle.\"\n\n\nIndu Khatri\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n\n\"There are two main reasons why quality training data is important. First one is that many problems are solved using Supervised Learning and training data forms the backbone for such applications. The second and more deeper reason is that with the advent of AutoML, democratization of ML skills, and open sourcing of cutting edge research and tools; they are no longer competitive advantages. The only way businesses can sustain a competitive advantage in AI applications is through differentiated training data.\"\n\n\nLavi Nigam\nData Scientist, Gartner\n\n\"In supervised learning, algorithms are dependent on training data to extract relevant patterns for future predictability, hence clean, unbiased and processed training data is crucially important. It’s like the “garbage in garbage out” rule for training any ML/DL models. Although, sometimes, we have lack of training data available and in such cases we have many new semi-supervised learning algorithms coming up. I see great future in such techniques as businesses all across the world don't work at Google/Facebook data scales mostly.\"\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\n\n“‘Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world’. With deep learning methods, we may say ‘Give me data big enough and I can predict anything.’ Data is the foundation of Machine Learning, especially the deep learning method, with the machines learning everything from data. If you feed a machine biased data, it gives you biased predictions. Garbage in, garbage out.”\n\n\nShuo Zhang\nSenior ML Engineer, Bose Corporation\n\n“One point I'd like to stress is the domain knowledge and domain specificity in ML. People sometimes think of ML as a ubiquitous technology that can be universally applied to any domain. But in reality, blindly applying ML is dangerous, and you should always know your domain and your data in a very deep way.”\n\n\nPiero Molino\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\n\n\"How would you train models without it? More seriously, quality and size of data are important because we are trying to tackle difficult tasks and we haven't figured out yet methods that are very robust to noise or that can be trained from smaller amounts of data.\"\n\n\nSparkle R. \nAssociate Director Data Science, Johnson & Johnson\n\n\"While innovative ML tools and techniques are being developed at a rapid pace, ML practitioners can sometimes get drawn into the novelty of applying newer approaches without realizing that the fundamentals of science and lack of high-quality data make many of these algorithms impractical for some healthcare facing solutions. Additionally, in our haste to publish our findings, researchers often forget that these systems will be used by an end-user (patient and provider), and expert level performance in development does not guarantee real-world clinical utility, adoption and transferability across heterogeneous healthcare systems. So, it is equally important that the end user’s workflow is also considered to ensure that the lab to real world transition is successful.\"\n\n\nYaman Kumar\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\n\n\"Training data is so important since most of the people, books, blogs, videos start and end with supervised learning. We currently do not know how to work in unsupervised settings. As we move towards unsupervised settings, the requirement of training data as we know it will reduce. In that world, gathering training data would not be an arduous task as it is supposed to be now.\"\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi\nArtificial Intelligence & Computer Science, University of Florida\n\n\"Training data is the backbone of any machine learning system, without sufficient training data, it is impossible for a machine to learn patterns or solve problems. The importance of training data illustrates why inadequate, or low quality training data, could lead to Machine Learning systems’ failure. Training data ought to be representative of all different groups within the sample without inheriting any societal prejudices.\"\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems & Strategy Lab\n\n\"I feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\"","seo_title":"10 Experts Give Reasons Why High-Quality Training Data is so Important","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"experts-high-quality-training-data-importance"},"tags":[{"_key":"HWRhI8n2","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"QPqXb7Bo","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"deOuCKuN","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"10 Experts Give Reasons Why High-Quality Training Data is so Important"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-22T23:06:59Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

We partnered with our friends from RE•WORK by asking a range of experts in Machine Learning what they believe will be the next big thing. \n\n\n\nTushar Chugh\n\nMachine Learning Software Engineer, Google\nTushar’s predictions for 2021 are very much based on the outcome of work already underway. The former General Motors trailblazer suggested that he was on the lookout for the following in 2021: 1. The “rapid” training, evaluation and productionization for the large sequence models (such as GPT-3, T5). 2. The research towards developing giant ML models that can cater to multi-model inputs from various tasks and that can generalize well to the new tasks.\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\n\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\nWith over 17 years at Pfizer working in AI, Sean has overseen tasks ranging from quantification of MRIs to multivariate analysis of disease progress and most recently, a global effort in drug safety assessments. When asked what he thought might be on the horizon for this year, Sean suggested “We may train the machine to predict the Machine Learning in 2021.” This rather funny response, if true, could see a move toward the automation in ML we have discussed for some years.\n\n\n\nAlireza Rostamzadeh\n\nData Science & Machine Learning, Apple\nAlireza’s predictions for the year ahead were quite something, and we love the sound of this! “2021 will be the year when we start to see more tangible ML-driven products; from significant improvements in self-driving cars to a wave of new products based on augmented reality”.\n\n\n\nShuo Zhang \n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation\nWorking across NLP, Deep Learning and now ML, Shuo has a range of experience. When asked, Shuo suggested that while the question in itself is extremely broad, “I'd say that less dependence on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large data is a path ML research is heading toward.” A step closer to the infamous automation buzzword.\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\n\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\nJason’s experience has spanned creative positions at Apple, Google and now Facebook, where he is working on a scalable reinforcement learning platform. When we asked Jason what he thought we could see in ML this year, he suggested “I predict that decision making AI will surge in popularity. Imagine an AI system that can tune constants in your code, or one that monitors your diet and suggests food. We have done a lot in the realm of signal processing but decision making continues to be an area with a lot of engineering trial-and-error.”\n\n\n\nSadid Hasan\n\nSenior Director of AI, CVS\n“In 2021, researchers would continue to take a leap in developing complex AI applications related to natural language understanding and generation by leveraging the ongoing advancements in multi-modal (text, speech, image) data fusion-based algorithms and more efficient transformer architectures. In addition, powerful synthetic data generation and augmentation techniques would enhance effective training of machine learning models by alleviating the challenges related to accessing sufficient ground-truth data. We would also see further emphasis on AI model’s ethicality, generalizability, explainability, and reproducibility along with efficient model Ops for a beneficial and robust on-device deployment. Furthermore, with the ongoing proliferation of healthcare data, the AI community would continue to build novel machine learning-based healthcare applications leading to increased AI adoption for providing meaningful decision-making support to end-users.”\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam \n\nData Scientist, Gartner\n“As more and more companies are heading towards AI/ML Maturity and working with more production scale ML/DL deployments, their focus in 2021 will be more on MLOps where they need to work on key aspects of processes like - Model/Data Drift Analysis, Model Interpretability, Data Governance, Model Scaling & AutoML. This year we will finally see many maturity models and practices for ML/DL operations coming up from different vendors and companies which will be very crucial in the long run.”\n\n\n\nBeat Raphael Schaad\n\nSenior Data Scientist, Sky\nThe Senior Data Scientist at Sky when asked his predictions for 2021 stayed very much on the hot topic of COVID. “The goal for 2021 is that Data can support governments beyond counting Covid19 cases and death rates. Given the recent events ML will have to improve massively in inference and causality issues. Forecasting methods using AI do not deliver anything on our historic events scenarios mainly because of the lack of explainability of the generated features.”\n\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri\n\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n2021 will be the Year of MLOps. Many cloud services such as GCP's AI Platform, AWS's Sagemaker have matured over the past years and are readily adaptable by ML teams. In 2021 and beyond Data Scientists would have to work collaboratively with DEs/MLEs to take their beautiful models from lab to production and realize business value.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\n\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\nThe former Senior ML practitioner at UBER, currently makes up part of Professor Chris Ré's Hazy Research group on ML systems in California. Piero suggested that in industry he believes “models will start to come closer instead of being in separate silos like it happens today in most cases. In academia, I believe there will be more research focused on robustness and generalization.”\n\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi \n\nResearch Assistant, University of Florida\n“The year 2020 has significantly changed our lives in many ways. The way we work, communicate and learn has been impacted in many significant ways. Artificial Intelligence continues to be a key technology trend when it comes to the things that will change how we live, work, and play in the near future. I predict that artificial intelligence will be the main technology in the following areas: If any threat such as COVID were to occur, then that should be detected ahead of time. To help businesses prepare for situations like this pandemic, we must understand how users behave during such an emergency.”\n\n\n\nDivya Sivasankaran\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Autodesk\n\"Over the last year, we've seen a lot of local AI startups being sold/acquired. Many are struggling to bring AI products to market. I believe the pandemic merely sped up the inevitable. The silver lining to me here is that we've managed to cut down on the hype (noise) giving us time and resources to focus on impact with tangible applications (signal). That's why I think 2021 will be the year we will start to see AI/ML features in production for real - i.e., AI will successfully make the transition from being a spice to a core ingredient.\"\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal\n\nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n“I think 2020 has changed the world around us in many ways, and the retail sector is no exception. The pandemic has taught everyone new ways of shopping whether it's online, curbside pickup or concierge services for senior members. And AI/ML has played a major role in shaping all these solutions everywhere. Going in 2021, I feel rather than quantity of data, the market will shift towards the quality of data being captured. As more and more data points are getting captured to make better ML models; need of the hour is to make light weight models that can run on edge devices to filter and capture just the meaningful data. I call it -- \"AI/ML for Intelligent Data collection.”\n\n\n\nShaina Raza\n\nResearch Assistant, Ryerson University\nShaina, a former lecturer and now Research Assistant in ML gave one of the more exciting predictions on the list, which would mean large scale change and positive development in the field in the months to come. “Machine Learning is going to be easier, cheaper and beyond the limitations. The exponential power of the computing resources will be in the hands of laymen, and we see the revolution of the world much more earlier than expected.”\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\n\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\nYaman’s research in ML revolves around Adversarial Networks, Interpretability, QA and Speech and is supported by Google doctoral Fellowship. Yaman simply suggested three compartments of ML which he believes will develop rapidly in 2021. “Unsupervised Learning, Explainability, and Fairness in ML.” Surprisingly, it was the only mention of unsupervised learning, which has seen to become somewhat of a buzzword at the backend of 2020.\n\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\n\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems & Strategy Lab\nI feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\n\n\n2021 is set to be uncertain in many ways. However, as with last year, hard work behind the scenes in AI and ML continues. The range of optimistic yet realistic predictions above, if accurate, could see 2021 as a year in which some of the largest steps in AI and Machine Learning advancement for some years take place.\n\nWhat do you think could be developed this year?","seo_title":"What's next? 17 Machine Learning Predictions for 2021","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"17-machine-learning-predictions-for-2021"},"tags":[{"_key":"94W8kEob","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"CKYpD6ea","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"CzXbg3oJ","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"What's next? 17 Machine Learning Predictions for 2021"}],"morePosts":[],"slug":"expert-advice","tagName":"Expert Advice","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true}
