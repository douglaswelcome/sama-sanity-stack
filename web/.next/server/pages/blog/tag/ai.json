We partnered with our friends from RE•WORK by asking a range of experts in Machine Learning what they believe will be the next big thing. \n\n\n\nTushar Chugh\n\nMachine Learning Software Engineer, Google\nTushar’s predictions for 2021 are very much based on the outcome of work already underway. The former General Motors trailblazer suggested that he was on the lookout for the following in 2021: 1. The “rapid” training, evaluation and productionization for the large sequence models (such as GPT-3, T5). 2. The research towards developing giant ML models that can cater to multi-model inputs from various tasks and that can generalize well to the new tasks.\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\n\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\nWith over 17 years at Pfizer working in AI, Sean has overseen tasks ranging from quantification of MRIs to multivariate analysis of disease progress and most recently, a global effort in drug safety assessments. When asked what he thought might be on the horizon for this year, Sean suggested “We may train the machine to predict the Machine Learning in 2021.” This rather funny response, if true, could see a move toward the automation in ML we have discussed for some years.\n\n\n\nAlireza Rostamzadeh\n\nData Science & Machine Learning, Apple\nAlireza’s predictions for the year ahead were quite something, and we love the sound of this! “2021 will be the year when we start to see more tangible ML-driven products; from significant improvements in self-driving cars to a wave of new products based on augmented reality”.\n\n\n\nShuo Zhang \n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation\nWorking across NLP, Deep Learning and now ML, Shuo has a range of experience. When asked, Shuo suggested that while the question in itself is extremely broad, “I'd say that less dependence on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large data is a path ML research is heading toward.” A step closer to the infamous automation buzzword.\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\n\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\nJason’s experience has spanned creative positions at Apple, Google and now Facebook, where he is working on a scalable reinforcement learning platform. When we asked Jason what he thought we could see in ML this year, he suggested “I predict that decision making AI will surge in popularity. Imagine an AI system that can tune constants in your code, or one that monitors your diet and suggests food. We have done a lot in the realm of signal processing but decision making continues to be an area with a lot of engineering trial-and-error.”\n\n\n\nSadid Hasan\n\nSenior Director of AI, CVS\n“In 2021, researchers would continue to take a leap in developing complex AI applications related to natural language understanding and generation by leveraging the ongoing advancements in multi-modal (text, speech, image) data fusion-based algorithms and more efficient transformer architectures. In addition, powerful synthetic data generation and augmentation techniques would enhance effective training of machine learning models by alleviating the challenges related to accessing sufficient ground-truth data. We would also see further emphasis on AI model’s ethicality, generalizability, explainability, and reproducibility along with efficient model Ops for a beneficial and robust on-device deployment. Furthermore, with the ongoing proliferation of healthcare data, the AI community would continue to build novel machine learning-based healthcare applications leading to increased AI adoption for providing meaningful decision-making support to end-users.”\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam \n\nData Scientist, Gartner\n“As more and more companies are heading towards AI/ML Maturity and working with more production scale ML/DL deployments, their focus in 2021 will be more on MLOps where they need to work on key aspects of processes like - Model/Data Drift Analysis, Model Interpretability, Data Governance, Model Scaling & AutoML. This year we will finally see many maturity models and practices for ML/DL operations coming up from different vendors and companies which will be very crucial in the long run.”\n\n\n\nBeat Raphael Schaad\n\nSenior Data Scientist, Sky\nThe Senior Data Scientist at Sky when asked his predictions for 2021 stayed very much on the hot topic of COVID. “The goal for 2021 is that Data can support governments beyond counting Covid19 cases and death rates. Given the recent events ML will have to improve massively in inference and causality issues. Forecasting methods using AI do not deliver anything on our historic events scenarios mainly because of the lack of explainability of the generated features.”\n\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri\n\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n2021 will be the Year of MLOps. Many cloud services such as GCP's AI Platform, AWS's Sagemaker have matured over the past years and are readily adaptable by ML teams. In 2021 and beyond Data Scientists would have to work collaboratively with DEs/MLEs to take their beautiful models from lab to production and realize business value.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\n\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\nThe former Senior ML practitioner at UBER, currently makes up part of Professor Chris Ré's Hazy Research group on ML systems in California. Piero suggested that in industry he believes “models will start to come closer instead of being in separate silos like it happens today in most cases. In academia, I believe there will be more research focused on robustness and generalization.”\n\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi \n\nResearch Assistant, University of Florida\n“The year 2020 has significantly changed our lives in many ways. The way we work, communicate and learn has been impacted in many significant ways. Artificial Intelligence continues to be a key technology trend when it comes to the things that will change how we live, work, and play in the near future. I predict that artificial intelligence will be the main technology in the following areas: If any threat such as COVID were to occur, then that should be detected ahead of time. To help businesses prepare for situations like this pandemic, we must understand how users behave during such an emergency.”\n\n\n\nDivya Sivasankaran\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Autodesk\n\"Over the last year, we've seen a lot of local AI startups being sold/acquired. Many are struggling to bring AI products to market. I believe the pandemic merely sped up the inevitable. The silver lining to me here is that we've managed to cut down on the hype (noise) giving us time and resources to focus on impact with tangible applications (signal). That's why I think 2021 will be the year we will start to see AI/ML features in production for real - i.e., AI will successfully make the transition from being a spice to a core ingredient.\"\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal\n\nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n“I think 2020 has changed the world around us in many ways, and the retail sector is no exception. The pandemic has taught everyone new ways of shopping whether it's online, curbside pickup or concierge services for senior members. And AI/ML has played a major role in shaping all these solutions everywhere. Going in 2021, I feel rather than quantity of data, the market will shift towards the quality of data being captured. As more and more data points are getting captured to make better ML models; need of the hour is to make light weight models that can run on edge devices to filter and capture just the meaningful data. I call it -- \"AI/ML for Intelligent Data collection.”\n\n\n\nShaina Raza\n\nResearch Assistant, Ryerson University\nShaina, a former lecturer and now Research Assistant in ML gave one of the more exciting predictions on the list, which would mean large scale change and positive development in the field in the months to come. “Machine Learning is going to be easier, cheaper and beyond the limitations. The exponential power of the computing resources will be in the hands of laymen, and we see the revolution of the world much more earlier than expected.”\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\n\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\nYaman’s research in ML revolves around Adversarial Networks, Interpretability, QA and Speech and is supported by Google doctoral Fellowship. Yaman simply suggested three compartments of ML which he believes will develop rapidly in 2021. “Unsupervised Learning, Explainability, and Fairness in ML.” Surprisingly, it was the only mention of unsupervised learning, which has seen to become somewhat of a buzzword at the backend of 2020.\n\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\n\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems & Strategy Lab\nI feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\n\n\n2021 is set to be uncertain in many ways. However, as with last year, hard work behind the scenes in AI and ML continues. The range of optimistic yet realistic predictions above, if accurate, could see 2021 as a year in which some of the largest steps in AI and Machine Learning advancement for some years take place.\n\nWhat do you think could be developed this year?","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"17-machine-learning-predictions-for-2021"},"tags":[{"_key":"94W8kEob","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"CKYpD6ea","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"CzXbg3oJ","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"What's next? 17 Machine Learning Predictions for 2021"},{"_createdAt":"2020-09-04T15:25:34Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

While it’s important to recognize that AI is still very much in its infancy in regard to large-scale change, there have been incremental advancements in recent years, which have somewhat gone under the radar for those not regularly perusing the latest AI news or working in said fields. To explore just how prevalent AI is in our everyday lives, we have collected five spaces in which AI is shaping consumer behavior and practices.\n\n1. Netflix\nThe entire catalogue of movies and shows at Netflix is ranked, customized and ordered for each individual user in a personalized manner using Machine Learning (yes, you can blame your roommate for messing up the algorithms and data). Through the use of Machine Learning, Netflix is able to forecast, and facilitate your next series binge with five key stages to their recommendation model: ranking & layout, similarities, evidence and search, model improvement and exploit learning. In short, Netflix uses customer engagement to find similarities and patterns in your watching data, alongside the categories you most often visit and even the artwork to which you’re drawn to. These hypotheses are then A/B tested for accuracy and developed to enhance user experience.\n\n2. Virtual Assistants\nOk, so this may seem like an obvious inclusion on this list, but many often don’t realize what it is that really helps to power Siri, Cortana and their industry colleagues. The seemingly simple command to action transaction is not as simple as it seems, with mere short sentences going through a variety of processes including recognition of wake words, speech processing, natural language understanding, text-to-speech and more. Many will remember that the initial virtual assistant offerings would often have many misspelled words, as well as an inability to understand the message and the obvious struggles with accents. However, projections for virtual assistants suggest that the already 20% voice search KPI on phones is set to increase, alongside adoption of VA into greater devices including cars and wearables. With the gradual implementation of VA into personal devices, it’s easy to overlook how far they have actually come!\n\n3. Online Shopping\nAI being used in e-commerce and online shopping is suggested to reach revenues of over $30 billion by 2025, which poses the question: how is it being implemented? Well, prediction of customer behavior is a crucial aspect of its success, auto-populating websites through algorithms made up of history, third party data, content data and other information to offer the necessary reference to the user. Alongside these examples, AI is also being used in the collection of data from consumers, listening to feedback, automation of review emails and product suggestions for retargeting. Alongside personalization and product recommendation, e-commerce retailers are now utilizing chatbots to provide 24/7 assistance, made possible through the development of self-learning capabilities and NLP. Interested in reading more? Check out our E-Commerce Guide.\n\n4. Education\nThere have been many early applications of AI in education, including, but not limited to grading, plagiarism detection, personalization and more. Recent developments in Machine Learning have seen companies like Gradescope using AI to develop assisted grouping techniques of handwritten answers from students. These groupings work on a points-based rubric allowing for accurate marking in seconds, which in-turn, can free up time for teachers and allows for greater lesson planning time, to name but a few benefits. Current AI algorithms are also being used to assist in the fight against plagiarism. Tools including Turnitin are using AI to locate copied sentences, structuring and other stylometrics alongside monitoring the creation and moderation dates of work. The future of AI in education, according to many, lies in the development of heavily tailored courses and classes for students with specific needs, which may not be as far off as you’d think with education startups receiving over 20 billion dollars worth of funding by the end of 2018.\n\n5. Ride Sharing\nRidesharing apps have been reported to use a variety of algorithms both for the benefit of the customers and organizations. It was only as recent as 2017 that Uber had admitted to adapting their pricing for rides based on customer data collected on socioeconomic factors of users. Seen as one of the first major adopters of AI, services like Uber have suggested that AI is central to almost every aspect of their business including fraud detection, risk assessment, safety processes, marketing spend and allocation, matching drivers and riders, route optimization and more. Ridesharing apps also use personal data in an anonymized and aggregated form to closely monitor which features of the service are used most. Through this, Uber and their competitors are able to analyze usage patterns and to determine where they should further focus developments.\n\nThese subtle implementations of AI across industries and in businesses may come as a surprise, but we have no doubt that over the next few years, AI adoption will not only become widespread, but increasingly publicized.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"ai-you-didnt-know-you-used"},"tags":[{"_key":"uZeu8hE2","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"oYVzsLww","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"5 Examples of AI You Didn't Know You Used"},{"_createdAt":"2020-07-17T18:31:06Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

We’re certainly betting on it: global spend on AI is predicted to be a whopping $98 Billion by 2023, up from 37.5 Billion in 2019. But we’re still in the early days when it comes to fulfilling the promise of AI and one of the reasons is training data—the annotated data a machine needs to learn to see or hear. Training data is essential to the development of any machine learning model. A global survey of Data Scientists, AI Experts and Stakeholders revealed that 8 out of 10 AI projects fail and 96% run into problems with data quality and labeling. \n\nEven applications now leading the scene have had their fair share of mishaps along the way. We’ve listed some examples of when AI might not have been performing at its best.\n\n\n\n1. The Somewhat Vulgar Virtual Assistant\n\nIt only took 24 hours for Tay, Microsoft's new conversational understanding chatbot, to start tweeting some extremely insensitive and offensive material online. The initial idea was to have Tay learn through ‘casual conversation’ with fellow Twitter users, which perhaps, at that time, was too far-fetched. While a majority of the 100k+ tweets were not considered to be eyebrow-raising, a selection of mimicking and extremely offensive posts saw Tay taken down after just one day. Unfortunately, the follow-up chatbot, ‘Zo’ resulted in the same fate, albeit after five months of live interaction.\n\n\n\n2. IBM Watson for Oncology\n\nMany see AI as the future of medicine, but it’s been suggested that IBMs Watson for Oncology initially over-promised and underdelivered with misdiagnosis, incorrect drug treatment offerings and unsafe judgement calls on patients. While there was and still is promise, the current ‘messy’ state of healthcare systems and mismatch between both the working and learning styles of doctors and machines became evident. Watson Oncology, however, continues to improve, with memory banks of every rare disease, increasing knowledge and a lack of cognitive bias potentially held by long serving medical professionals.\n\n\n\n3. Amazon AI Bias Recruitment\n\nNow scrapped, the once used AI recruiting tool from Amazon was found to be perpetuating the gender gap in tech jobs. The initial hope for a perfect filtration system for the top applications, was soon found to host significant bias towards hiring men due to being trained on resumes submitted in previous years—which were predominantly from male applicants. The use of historical data which facilitated existing bias has seen great advancements in regard to hiring diverse talent, but continues to have a long road ahead.\n\n\n\n4. Purchasing on Alexa\n\nResearch suggests that by 2023 over eight billion voice assistants will be present in consumers' lives. We predict many of these will be subject of, or susceptible to, some humorous moments while in development. We have seen doll houses ordered through ads on television (oops!), parrots casually chatting with Alexa, hacking issues, and all sorts. There is no doubt that the virtual assistant has further developed to a more accurate level since, but we’re excited for the future of viral YouTube videos to come.\n\n\n\n5. Insurance company uses social media data to issue rates, shows bias\n\nAdmiral Insurance, a popular company for first-time drivers, aimed to embed AI to analyse the Facebook data of those applying for insurance as they claimed there was a ‘proven link’ between personality and their driving style or ability. Facebook was quick to stop any advancements in this due to underlying ethical concerns, data privacy and potential bias of models.\n\nWhile AI carries a lot of promise, it also carries a lot of hype. When it comes to AI, your model is only as good as the data it’s trained on, because here applies: garbage in, garbage out.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-training-data-challenge-5-ai-fails"},"tags":[{"_key":"3firrVWY","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"93GN7laV","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"WeyhHs1O","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"The Training Data Challenge: 5 AI Fails"},{"_createdAt":"2020-05-12T16:08:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

And unlike human-driven cars, AVs rely solely on their computer vision system and the data used to train them to navigate the world around us.\n\nCurrently, the best self-driving assistance systems incorrectly perceive something in their environment once every tens of thousands of hours. If that object is a traffic light, and the car gets it wrong, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., are all at risk. Here’s a look at the traffic light problem for autonomous cars from three perspectives. \n\n\n\n1. Traffic lights tell road users when to stop and go, but they only work when everyone follows the rules.\n\nTraffic lights are an engineered system, timed around traffic patterns. There are rules in place that tell cars when to stop and go, but the inherent human behavior of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists sometimes means these rules are loosely interpreted.\n\nThere are no physical barriers forcing road users to abide by traffic signals. They work because drivers follow the rules. AVs must also get the rules right, and that means countless hours of real-world exposure to the unspoken rules (or lack thereof) of the road.\n\nThe quality and accuracy of the data received from sensor packages must be precise, leaving no room for interpretation or inconsistencies. Also, license plates, faces or other personal identifying information (PII) may need to be anonymized to protect the privacy of people who might appear in the raw footage. \n\nEnsuring AVs learn the right rules requires unbiased, appropriately labeled and high-quality training data based on a range of driving scenarios.\n\n\n\n2. Traffic lights challenge both the vision system and the team developing the algorithms.\n\nBecause traffic lights are not a distance detection problem, AVs cannot use lidar or radar to navigate traffic signals. They must rely solely on their computer vision system to understand when to stop and go.\n\nThis can be difficult for both the vision system as well as the team developing the algorithm because the visibility of traffic lights may vary based on weather conditions like bright sunlight, rain, snow or fog. Similarly, not all intersections have traffic lights, so if the AV doesn’t detect one, that could be correct.\n\nThe treatment of out of service traffic signals can also vary. One city might use a plastic bag to indicate an out-of-service light while another city, or even county, might use masking tape or some other method to cover broken traffic signals.\n\nContext clues like head nods or hand signals help human drivers manage low visibility or the lack of a traffic light, but since AVs cannot register this supplemental visual information, machine learning and computer vision engineers must train the AV on such scenarios as they arise.\n\n3. Stock datasets aren’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely.\n\nThe volume and diversity of data required for autonomous vehicles is vast, and stock datasets cannot cover all use cases.\n\nDuncan Curtis, Sama VP of Product shares approximately 1,000 to 10,000 images are needed to deploy a solution onto a vehicle, and in order to launch a product publicly, approximately 10,000 to 100,000 images are needed per ADAS feature. That’s a lot of data, and the amount of data needed to account for edge cases like traffic lights in unique road conditions is unknown.\n\nSince AVs often need data from a specific camera or sensor package (because that’s what the car will use in production), generic stock data isn’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely. In addition to this, models need to be refreshed with ongoing training data as road rules, and the world around us changes.\n\nOur team of data labeling experts annotate over 4M tasks per month, and for AV use cases, we’ve achieved 99.5 percent quality SLAs with more than 100 tags per image. We’ve also successfully achieved full productivity within our labeling teams in as little as two to five days.\n\nIf you need ground truth data for your ML model, connect with our team for a virtual consultation and demo of our industry-leading data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-traffic-light-problem-for-autonomous-vehicles"},"tags":[{"_key":"ivLPY6Ly","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"Liw4Inz5","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"3LVFK315","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"YhUSiZyI","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"72HsQzsx","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles"},{"_createdAt":"2020-02-28T21:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"b4d4d096-8187-41fa-a386-87ce949c9915","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-45005425be54d2d450b1aa53f7d9435477531eb3-1664x1758-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Liliosa is the Impact and Marketing Manager at Sama.","name":"Liliosa Mbirimi Muturi","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"liliosa-mbirimi-muturi"}},"estimatedReadingTime":6,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-7e68dc7b894694d301fe5feff694b3df88f8beda-2048x1365-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"plaintextBody":"In a small town in Northern Uganda, Ocem turns on his lights at 6am to get ready for work. It’s his second year working at Sama, and before becoming an AI trainer, he was a student at the local university, moonlighting as a farmer.\n\nWorking in AI was not a path Ocem imagined until he was recruited to work at Sama. In fact, like many students, his greatest uncertainty was whether he could put his degree to good use at all, post graduation.\n\nOcem’s story is like many other young professionals in East Africa, but as AI adoption explodes, these talented, untapped communities are finding work they never thought possible, at the cutting edge of AI.\n\nHere are four ways AI makes a positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nGainful Employment\n\nA report by the World Bank shared that 60 percent of the unemployed in Africa are youth, who after graduating from University will take on average, one year to find employment in their field of study. \n\nI believe this is due to the lack of formal career opportunities within the region, making it difficult for the employment industry to support the volume of college graduates entering the workforce.\n\nAs a result, talented graduates find work in menial jobs that often don’t provide a sustainable income, but Sama and other tech companies are working to fix that.\n\nThe explosion of AI has birthed the demand for high-quality, ground truth data for artificial intelligence, and with training, recent graduates like Ocem can find meaningful work in the growing digital economy.\n\nDriven by a mission to expand opportunity for low-income people, Sama's social impact business model has helped over 50,000 people move themselves out of poverty through digital work.\n\nWorkers in our East Africa centers are paid a living wage and competitive benefits. They also receive ongoing digital skills training and have access to professional development opportunities that further help increase the purchasing power of their communities, potentially ending a long cycle of poverty.\n\nSkills and Knowledge\n\nAs more tech companies expand operations to Africa, and more people start gaining on-the-job experience working in machine learning and AI, the positive impact AI makes on communities in East Africa will only expand.\n\nI’ve personally witnessed how energized the youth in East Africa are about the intricacies of enriching data for AI. For many, this budding tech boom has motivated them to enroll in courses centered around data sciences and AI.\n\nAlso, the Deep Learning Indaba, an annual meeting for AI enthusiasts in Africa has brought together a growing number of youths for week long discussions, debates and research on machine learning and AI.\n\nWith a reliable IT infrastructure, paired with increased trust in the skill level of youth workers in the region, East Africa has the potential to become a major hub for AI training data.\n\nAt Sama, our AI training classes fill up weekly, and this level of investment in skills development for young professionals is what’s needed to continue developing the talent pool. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nUnesco reported that 30% of the tech-workforce in sub-Saharan Africa are women, and despite the challenges of gender discrimination in the technology sector, the percentage of female workers is steadily growing. \n\nWomen in Africa have often been set apart from the tech industry because culturally, they were considered primary caretakers, expected to focus on their family, not their career. Now, the vast opportunities in AI are helping to change that.\n\nWe actively recruit women and youth to work in our East Africa centers, providing in-depth technical training, so underserved communities can pursue a career in AI. From scholarship programs to nursing rooms, we’ve also made it a priority to establish an office culture conducive to the success of women workers.\n\nOur baseline survey data found that women earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, before joining Sama. By ensuring we achieve gender parity in pay, while simultaneously paying a living wage, our workers can support themselves and their families sustainably.\n\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nAs more populations in Africa adopt mobile technology and digital apps, their exposure to AI-enabled technologies that collect data to improve experiences will only increase. These interactions can be as simple as product recommendations from an online store, or interactions with an automated messenger bot.\n\nGiven the rapid advancement of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) , the Kenyan government recently passed a data protection law which complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nSimilar to GDPR, this legislation outlines restrictions on data handling and sharing, in an effort to regulate the processing of personal data and information in the country.\n\nThis commitment to increased digital security will no doubt have a positive impact on the citizens of Kenya, and in many ways, it sets the standard for data privacy and protection across the continent.\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute predicts that AI has the potential to deliver an additional economic output of $13 trillion by 2030. This economic growth, alongside the digital transformation of sub-Saharan Africa will have enormous positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama connects people to dignified digital work, you can read about our social business model here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-ways-ai-makes-a-positive-impact-on-communities-in-east-africa"},"tags":[{"_key":"AEPEpJXp","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"tc6Hsfbm","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"VmY4sBKG","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"iLYfly0n","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa"},{"_createdAt":"2019-12-20T02:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.
