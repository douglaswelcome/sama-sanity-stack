We partnered with our friends from RE•WORK by asking a range of experts in Machine Learning what they believe will be the next big thing. \n\n\n\nTushar Chugh\n\nMachine Learning Software Engineer, Google\nTushar’s predictions for 2021 are very much based on the outcome of work already underway. The former General Motors trailblazer suggested that he was on the lookout for the following in 2021: 1. The “rapid” training, evaluation and productionization for the large sequence models (such as GPT-3, T5). 2. The research towards developing giant ML models that can cater to multi-model inputs from various tasks and that can generalize well to the new tasks.\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\n\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\nWith over 17 years at Pfizer working in AI, Sean has overseen tasks ranging from quantification of MRIs to multivariate analysis of disease progress and most recently, a global effort in drug safety assessments. When asked what he thought might be on the horizon for this year, Sean suggested “We may train the machine to predict the Machine Learning in 2021.” This rather funny response, if true, could see a move toward the automation in ML we have discussed for some years.\n\n\n\nAlireza Rostamzadeh\n\nData Science \u0026 Machine Learning, Apple\nAlireza’s predictions for the year ahead were quite something, and we love the sound of this! “2021 will be the year when we start to see more tangible ML-driven products; from significant improvements in self-driving cars to a wave of new products based on augmented reality”.\n\n\n\nShuo Zhang \n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation\nWorking across NLP, Deep Learning and now ML, Shuo has a range of experience. When asked, Shuo suggested that while the question in itself is extremely broad, “I'd say that less dependence on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large data is a path ML research is heading toward.” A step closer to the infamous automation buzzword.\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\n\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\nJason’s experience has spanned creative positions at Apple, Google and now Facebook, where he is working on a scalable reinforcement learning platform. When we asked Jason what he thought we could see in ML this year, he suggested “I predict that decision making AI will surge in popularity. Imagine an AI system that can tune constants in your code, or one that monitors your diet and suggests food. We have done a lot in the realm of signal processing but decision making continues to be an area with a lot of engineering trial-and-error.”\n\n\n\nSadid Hasan\n\nSenior Director of AI, CVS\n“In 2021, researchers would continue to take a leap in developing complex AI applications related to natural language understanding and generation by leveraging the ongoing advancements in multi-modal (text, speech, image) data fusion-based algorithms and more efficient transformer architectures. In addition, powerful synthetic data generation and augmentation techniques would enhance effective training of machine learning models by alleviating the challenges related to accessing sufficient ground-truth data. We would also see further emphasis on AI model’s ethicality, generalizability, explainability, and reproducibility along with efficient model Ops for a beneficial and robust on-device deployment. Furthermore, with the ongoing proliferation of healthcare data, the AI community would continue to build novel machine learning-based healthcare applications leading to increased AI adoption for providing meaningful decision-making support to end-users.”\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam \n\nData Scientist, Gartner\n“As more and more companies are heading towards AI/ML Maturity and working with more production scale ML/DL deployments, their focus in 2021 will be more on MLOps where they need to work on key aspects of processes like - Model/Data Drift Analysis, Model Interpretability, Data Governance, Model Scaling \u0026 AutoML. This year we will finally see many maturity models and practices for ML/DL operations coming up from different vendors and companies which will be very crucial in the long run.”\n\n\n\nBeat Raphael Schaad\n\nSenior Data Scientist, Sky\nThe Senior Data Scientist at Sky when asked his predictions for 2021 stayed very much on the hot topic of COVID. “The goal for 2021 is that Data can support governments beyond counting Covid19 cases and death rates. Given the recent events ML will have to improve massively in inference and causality issues. Forecasting methods using AI do not deliver anything on our historic events scenarios mainly because of the lack of explainability of the generated features.”\n\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri\n\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n2021 will be the Year of MLOps. Many cloud services such as GCP's AI Platform, AWS's Sagemaker have matured over the past years and are readily adaptable by ML teams. In 2021 and beyond Data Scientists would have to work collaboratively with DEs/MLEs to take their beautiful models from lab to production and realize business value.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\n\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\nThe former Senior ML practitioner at UBER, currently makes up part of Professor Chris Ré's Hazy Research group on ML systems in California. Piero suggested that in industry he believes “models will start to come closer instead of being in separate silos like it happens today in most cases. In academia, I believe there will be more research focused on robustness and generalization.”\n\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi \n\nResearch Assistant, University of Florida\n“The year 2020 has significantly changed our lives in many ways. The way we work, communicate and learn has been impacted in many significant ways. Artificial Intelligence continues to be a key technology trend when it comes to the things that will change how we live, work, and play in the near future. I predict that artificial intelligence will be the main technology in the following areas: If any threat such as COVID were to occur, then that should be detected ahead of time. To help businesses prepare for situations like this pandemic, we must understand how users behave during such an emergency.”\n\n\n\nDivya Sivasankaran\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Autodesk\n\"Over the last year, we've seen a lot of local AI startups being sold/acquired. Many are struggling to bring AI products to market. I believe the pandemic merely sped up the inevitable. The silver lining to me here is that we've managed to cut down on the hype (noise) giving us time and resources to focus on impact with tangible applications (signal). That's why I think 2021 will be the year we will start to see AI/ML features in production for real - i.e., AI will successfully make the transition from being a spice to a core ingredient.\"\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal\n\nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n“I think 2020 has changed the world around us in many ways, and the retail sector is no exception. The pandemic has taught everyone new ways of shopping whether it's online, curbside pickup or concierge services for senior members. And AI/ML has played a major role in shaping all these solutions everywhere. Going in 2021, I feel rather than quantity of data, the market will shift towards the quality of data being captured. As more and more data points are getting captured to make better ML models; need of the hour is to make light weight models that can run on edge devices to filter and capture just the meaningful data. I call it -- \"AI/ML for Intelligent Data collection.”\n\n\n\nShaina Raza\n\nResearch Assistant, Ryerson University\nShaina, a former lecturer and now Research Assistant in ML gave one of the more exciting predictions on the list, which would mean large scale change and positive development in the field in the months to come. “Machine Learning is going to be easier, cheaper and beyond the limitations. The exponential power of the computing resources will be in the hands of laymen, and we see the revolution of the world much more earlier than expected.”\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\n\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\nYaman’s research in ML revolves around Adversarial Networks, Interpretability, QA and Speech and is supported by Google doctoral Fellowship. Yaman simply suggested three compartments of ML which he believes will develop rapidly in 2021. “Unsupervised Learning, Explainability, and Fairness in ML.” Surprisingly, it was the only mention of unsupervised learning, which has seen to become somewhat of a buzzword at the backend of 2020.\n\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\n\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems \u0026 Strategy Lab\nI feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\n\n\n2021 is set to be uncertain in many ways. However, as with last year, hard work behind the scenes in AI and ML continues. The range of optimistic yet realistic predictions above, if accurate, could see 2021 as a year in which some of the largest steps in AI and Machine Learning advancement for some years take place.\n\nWhat do you think could be developed this year?","seo_title":"What's next? 17 Machine Learning Predictions for 2021","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"17-machine-learning-predictions-for-2021"},"tags":[{"_key":"94W8kEob","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"CKYpD6ea","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"CzXbg3oJ","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"What's next? 17 Machine Learning Predictions for 2021"},{"_createdAt":"2020-09-04T15:25:34Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"AI is often framed as something that’ll change our future, but many people aren’t aware of quite the extent to which AI already used in society and everyday life. While it’s important to recognize that AI is still very much in its infancy in regard to large-scale change, there have been incremental advancements in recent years, which have somewhat gone under the radar for those not regularly perusing the latest AI news or working in said fields. To explore just how prevalent AI is in our everyday lives, we have collected five spaces in which AI is shaping consumer behavior and practices.\n\n1. Netflix\nThe entire catalogue of movies and shows at Netflix is ranked, customized and ordered for each individual user in a personalized manner using Machine Learning (yes, you can blame your roommate for messing up the algorithms and data). Through the use of Machine Learning, Netflix is able to forecast, and facilitate your next series binge with five key stages to their recommendation model: ranking \u0026 layout, similarities, evidence and search, model improvement and exploit learning. In short, Netflix uses customer engagement to find similarities and patterns in your watching data, alongside the categories you most often visit and even the artwork to which you’re drawn to. These hypotheses are then A/B tested for accuracy and developed to enhance user experience.\n\n2. Virtual Assistants\nOk, so this may seem like an obvious inclusion on this list, but many often don’t realize what it is that really helps to power Siri, Cortana and their industry colleagues. The seemingly simple command to action transaction is not as simple as it seems, with mere short sentences going through a variety of processes including recognition of wake words, speech processing, natural language understanding, text-to-speech and more. Many will remember that the initial virtual assistant offerings would often have many misspelled words, as well as an inability to understand the message and the obvious struggles with accents. However, projections for virtual assistants suggest that the already 20% voice search KPI on phones is set to increase, alongside adoption of VA into greater devices including cars and wearables. With the gradual implementation of VA into personal devices, it’s easy to overlook how far they have actually come!\n\n3. Online Shopping\nAI being used in e-commerce and online shopping is suggested to reach revenues of over $30 billion by 2025, which poses the question: how is it being implemented? Well, prediction of customer behavior is a crucial aspect of its success, auto-populating websites through algorithms made up of history, third party data, content data and other information to offer the necessary reference to the user. Alongside these examples, AI is also being used in the collection of data from consumers, listening to feedback, automation of review emails and product suggestions for retargeting. Alongside personalization and product recommendation, e-commerce retailers are now utilizing chatbots to provide 24/7 assistance, made possible through the development of self-learning capabilities and NLP. Interested in reading more? Check out our E-Commerce Guide.\n\n4. Education\nThere have been many early applications of AI in education, including, but not limited to grading, plagiarism detection, personalization and more. Recent developments in Machine Learning have seen companies like Gradescope using AI to develop assisted grouping techniques of handwritten answers from students. These groupings work on a points-based rubric allowing for accurate marking in seconds, which in-turn, can free up time for teachers and allows for greater lesson planning time, to name but a few benefits. Current AI algorithms are also being used to assist in the fight against plagiarism. Tools including Turnitin are using AI to locate copied sentences, structuring and other stylometrics alongside monitoring the creation and moderation dates of work. The future of AI in education, according to many, lies in the development of heavily tailored courses and classes for students with specific needs, which may not be as far off as you’d think with education startups receiving over 20 billion dollars worth of funding by the end of 2018.\n\n5. Ride Sharing\nRidesharing apps have been reported to use a variety of algorithms both for the benefit of the customers and organizations. It was only as recent as 2017 that Uber had admitted to adapting their pricing for rides based on customer data collected on socioeconomic factors of users. Seen as one of the first major adopters of AI, services like Uber have suggested that AI is central to almost every aspect of their business including fraud detection, risk assessment, safety processes, marketing spend and allocation, matching drivers and riders, route optimization and more. Ridesharing apps also use personal data in an anonymized and aggregated form to closely monitor which features of the service are used most. Through this, Uber and their competitors are able to analyze usage patterns and to determine where they should further focus developments.\n\nThese subtle implementations of AI across industries and in businesses may come as a surprise, but we have no doubt that over the next few years, AI adoption will not only become widespread, but increasingly publicized.","seo_title":"5 Examples of AI You Didn't Know You Used","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"ai-you-didnt-know-you-used"},"tags":[{"_key":"uZeu8hE2","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"oYVzsLww","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"5 Examples of AI You Didn't Know You Used"},{"_createdAt":"2020-07-17T18:31:06Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

We’re certainly betting on it: global spend on AI is predicted to be a whopping $98 Billion by 2023, up from 37.5 Billion in 2019. But we’re still in the early days when it comes to fulfilling the promise of AI and one of the reasons is training data—the annotated data a machine needs to learn to see or hear. Training data is essential to the development of any machine learning model. A global survey of Data Scientists, AI Experts and Stakeholders revealed that 8 out of 10 AI projects fail and 96% run into problems with data quality and labeling. \n\nEven applications now leading the scene have had their fair share of mishaps along the way. We’ve listed some examples of when AI might not have been performing at its best.\n\n\n\n1. The Somewhat Vulgar Virtual Assistant\n\nIt only took 24 hours for Tay, Microsoft's new conversational understanding chatbot, to start tweeting some extremely insensitive and offensive material online. The initial idea was to have Tay learn through ‘casual conversation’ with fellow Twitter users, which perhaps, at that time, was too far-fetched. While a majority of the 100k+ tweets were not considered to be eyebrow-raising, a selection of mimicking and extremely offensive posts saw Tay taken down after just one day. Unfortunately, the follow-up chatbot, ‘Zo’ resulted in the same fate, albeit after five months of live interaction.\n\n\n\n2. IBM Watson for Oncology\n\nMany see AI as the future of medicine, but it’s been suggested that IBMs Watson for Oncology initially over-promised and underdelivered with misdiagnosis, incorrect drug treatment offerings and unsafe judgement calls on patients. While there was and still is promise, the current ‘messy’ state of healthcare systems and mismatch between both the working and learning styles of doctors and machines became evident. Watson Oncology, however, continues to improve, with memory banks of every rare disease, increasing knowledge and a lack of cognitive bias potentially held by long serving medical professionals.\n\n\n\n3. Amazon AI Bias Recruitment\n\nNow scrapped, the once used AI recruiting tool from Amazon was found to be perpetuating the gender gap in tech jobs. The initial hope for a perfect filtration system for the top applications, was soon found to host significant bias towards hiring men due to being trained on resumes submitted in previous years—which were predominantly from male applicants. The use of historical data which facilitated existing bias has seen great advancements in regard to hiring diverse talent, but continues to have a long road ahead.\n\n\n\n4. Purchasing on Alexa\n\nResearch suggests that by 2023 over eight billion voice assistants will be present in consumers' lives. We predict many of these will be subject of, or susceptible to, some humorous moments while in development. We have seen doll houses ordered through ads on television (oops!), parrots casually chatting with Alexa, hacking issues, and all sorts. There is no doubt that the virtual assistant has further developed to a more accurate level since, but we’re excited for the future of viral YouTube videos to come.\n\n\n\n5. Insurance company uses social media data to issue rates, shows bias\n\nAdmiral Insurance, a popular company for first-time drivers, aimed to embed AI to analyse the Facebook data of those applying for insurance as they claimed there was a ‘proven link’ between personality and their driving style or ability. Facebook was quick to stop any advancements in this due to underlying ethical concerns, data privacy and potential bias of models.\n\nWhile AI carries a lot of promise, it also carries a lot of hype. When it comes to AI, your model is only as good as the data it’s trained on, because here applies: garbage in, garbage out.","seo_title":"The Training Data Challenge: 5 AI Fails","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-training-data-challenge-5-ai-fails"},"tags":[{"_key":"3firrVWY","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"93GN7laV","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"WeyhHs1O","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"The Training Data Challenge: 5 AI Fails"},{"_createdAt":"2020-05-12T16:08:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

And unlike human-driven cars, AVs rely solely on their computer vision system and the data used to train them to navigate the world around us.\n\nCurrently, the best self-driving assistance systems incorrectly perceive something in their environment once every tens of thousands of hours. If that object is a traffic light, and the car gets it wrong, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., are all at risk. Here’s a look at the traffic light problem for autonomous cars from three perspectives. \n\n\n\n1. Traffic lights tell road users when to stop and go, but they only work when everyone follows the rules.\n\nTraffic lights are an engineered system, timed around traffic patterns. There are rules in place that tell cars when to stop and go, but the inherent human behavior of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists sometimes means these rules are loosely interpreted.\n\nThere are no physical barriers forcing road users to abide by traffic signals. They work because drivers follow the rules. AVs must also get the rules right, and that means countless hours of real-world exposure to the unspoken rules (or lack thereof) of the road.\n\nThe quality and accuracy of the data received from sensor packages must be precise, leaving no room for interpretation or inconsistencies. Also, license plates, faces or other personal identifying information (PII) may need to be anonymized to protect the privacy of people who might appear in the raw footage. \n\nEnsuring AVs learn the right rules requires unbiased, appropriately labeled and high-quality training data based on a range of driving scenarios.\n\n\n\n2. Traffic lights challenge both the vision system and the team developing the algorithms.\n\nBecause traffic lights are not a distance detection problem, AVs cannot use lidar or radar to navigate traffic signals. They must rely solely on their computer vision system to understand when to stop and go.\n\nThis can be difficult for both the vision system as well as the team developing the algorithm because the visibility of traffic lights may vary based on weather conditions like bright sunlight, rain, snow or fog. Similarly, not all intersections have traffic lights, so if the AV doesn’t detect one, that could be correct.\n\nThe treatment of out of service traffic signals can also vary. One city might use a plastic bag to indicate an out-of-service light while another city, or even county, might use masking tape or some other method to cover broken traffic signals.\n\nContext clues like head nods or hand signals help human drivers manage low visibility or the lack of a traffic light, but since AVs cannot register this supplemental visual information, machine learning and computer vision engineers must train the AV on such scenarios as they arise.\n\n3. Stock datasets aren’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely.\n\nThe volume and diversity of data required for autonomous vehicles is vast, and stock datasets cannot cover all use cases.\n\nDuncan Curtis, Sama VP of Product shares approximately 1,000 to 10,000 images are needed to deploy a solution onto a vehicle, and in order to launch a product publicly, approximately 10,000 to 100,000 images are needed per ADAS feature. That’s a lot of data, and the amount of data needed to account for edge cases like traffic lights in unique road conditions is unknown.\n\nSince AVs often need data from a specific camera or sensor package (because that’s what the car will use in production), generic stock data isn’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely. In addition to this, models need to be refreshed with ongoing training data as road rules, and the world around us changes.\n\nOur team of data labeling experts annotate over 4M tasks per month, and for AV use cases, we’ve achieved 99.5 percent quality SLAs with more than 100 tags per image. We’ve also successfully achieved full productivity within our labeling teams in as little as two to five days.\n\nIf you need ground truth data for your ML model, connect with our team for a virtual consultation and demo of our industry-leading data annotation platform.","seo_title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-traffic-light-problem-for-autonomous-vehicles"},"tags":[{"_key":"ivLPY6Ly","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"Liw4Inz5","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"3LVFK315","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"YhUSiZyI","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"72HsQzsx","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles"},{"_createdAt":"2020-02-28T21:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"b4d4d096-8187-41fa-a386-87ce949c9915","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-45005425be54d2d450b1aa53f7d9435477531eb3-1664x1758-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Liliosa is the Impact and Marketing Manager at Sama.","name":"Liliosa Mbirimi Muturi","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"liliosa-mbirimi-muturi"}},"estimatedReadingTime":6,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-7e68dc7b894694d301fe5feff694b3df88f8beda-2048x1365-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"meta_description":"As AI adoption expands, untapped communities are finding work at the cutting edge of AI. Here are 4 ways AI makes a positive impact on communities in East Africa.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"In a small town in Northern Uganda, Ocem turns on his lights at 6am to get ready for work. It’s his second year working at Sama, and before becoming an AI trainer, he was a student at the local university, moonlighting as a farmer.\n\nWorking in AI was not a path Ocem imagined until he was recruited to work at Sama. In fact, like many students, his greatest uncertainty was whether he could put his degree to good use at all, post graduation.\n\nOcem’s story is like many other young professionals in East Africa, but as AI adoption explodes, these talented, untapped communities are finding work they never thought possible, at the cutting edge of AI.\n\nHere are four ways AI makes a positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nGainful Employment\n\nA report by the World Bank shared that 60 percent of the unemployed in Africa are youth, who after graduating from University will take on average, one year to find employment in their field of study. \n\nI believe this is due to the lack of formal career opportunities within the region, making it difficult for the employment industry to support the volume of college graduates entering the workforce.\n\nAs a result, talented graduates find work in menial jobs that often don’t provide a sustainable income, but Sama and other tech companies are working to fix that.\n\nThe explosion of AI has birthed the demand for high-quality, ground truth data for artificial intelligence, and with training, recent graduates like Ocem can find meaningful work in the growing digital economy.\n\nDriven by a mission to expand opportunity for low-income people, Sama's social impact business model has helped over 50,000 people move themselves out of poverty through digital work.\n\nWorkers in our East Africa centers are paid a living wage and competitive benefits. They also receive ongoing digital skills training and have access to professional development opportunities that further help increase the purchasing power of their communities, potentially ending a long cycle of poverty.\n\nSkills and Knowledge\n\nAs more tech companies expand operations to Africa, and more people start gaining on-the-job experience working in machine learning and AI, the positive impact AI makes on communities in East Africa will only expand.\n\nI’ve personally witnessed how energized the youth in East Africa are about the intricacies of enriching data for AI. For many, this budding tech boom has motivated them to enroll in courses centered around data sciences and AI.\n\nAlso, the Deep Learning Indaba, an annual meeting for AI enthusiasts in Africa has brought together a growing number of youths for week long discussions, debates and research on machine learning and AI.\n\nWith a reliable IT infrastructure, paired with increased trust in the skill level of youth workers in the region, East Africa has the potential to become a major hub for AI training data.\n\nAt Sama, our AI training classes fill up weekly, and this level of investment in skills development for young professionals is what’s needed to continue developing the talent pool. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nUnesco reported that 30% of the tech-workforce in sub-Saharan Africa are women, and despite the challenges of gender discrimination in the technology sector, the percentage of female workers is steadily growing. \n\nWomen in Africa have often been set apart from the tech industry because culturally, they were considered primary caretakers, expected to focus on their family, not their career. Now, the vast opportunities in AI are helping to change that.\n\nWe actively recruit women and youth to work in our East Africa centers, providing in-depth technical training, so underserved communities can pursue a career in AI. From scholarship programs to nursing rooms, we’ve also made it a priority to establish an office culture conducive to the success of women workers.\n\nOur baseline survey data found that women earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, before joining Sama. By ensuring we achieve gender parity in pay, while simultaneously paying a living wage, our workers can support themselves and their families sustainably.\n\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nAs more populations in Africa adopt mobile technology and digital apps, their exposure to AI-enabled technologies that collect data to improve experiences will only increase. These interactions can be as simple as product recommendations from an online store, or interactions with an automated messenger bot.\n\nGiven the rapid advancement of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) , the Kenyan government recently passed a data protection law which complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nSimilar to GDPR, this legislation outlines restrictions on data handling and sharing, in an effort to regulate the processing of personal data and information in the country.\n\nThis commitment to increased digital security will no doubt have a positive impact on the citizens of Kenya, and in many ways, it sets the standard for data privacy and protection across the continent.\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute predicts that AI has the potential to deliver an additional economic output of $13 trillion by 2030. This economic growth, alongside the digital transformation of sub-Saharan Africa will have enormous positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama connects people to dignified digital work, you can read about our social business model here.","seo_title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-ways-ai-makes-a-positive-impact-on-communities-in-east-africa"},"tags":[{"_key":"AEPEpJXp","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"tc6Hsfbm","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"VmY4sBKG","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"iLYfly0n","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa"},{"_createdAt":"2019-12-20T02:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

I'm your host, Sharon L. Hadden, an AI enthusiast and content marketing manager at Sama.\n\nFrédéric Ratle is the Head of Artificial Intelligence at Sama. He brings 15+ years of R\u0026D experience in machine learning, AI, NLP and computer vision to his role at the company. Frédéric holds a PhD in machine learning, has published numerous research papers and has experience bringing products to market across multiple industries, including healthcare, automotive, consumer electronics and retail.\n\n(00:56) Hi Frédéric. Thanks for joining me today. A little bit about my background, I worked at NVIDIA for a number of years, and it was my first intro into machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence. The number one question we were always asked is what's the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence?\n\n(01:21) It's a really good question. Well, machine learning specifically is concerned with algorithms that can efficiently learn from data. For example, building a classifier that can learn to distinguish, let's say lion images from tiger images based on a set of labeled images is a typical machine learning problem, but it's a subset of AI because AI also includes approaches that aren't data-driven, which I refer to as symbolic approaches. For example, rule-based systems or knowledge or ontology based systems.\n\nThose are AI, but they're not specifically machine learning. Knowing this, the distinction has been a little bit blurred. So we tend to call everything AI. Another difference is that AI implies some kind of goal of mimicking human intelligence, while machine learning clearly is in engineering territory and really aimed at building data-driven decision making systems.\n\n(02:18) That's a great way to put it, Frédéric, and where does deep learning fit into the picture of all of this?\n\n(02:26) Right, so deep learning is a part of machine learning. It's a class of models in machine learning so it's also concerned with algorithms that can learn from data. But the difference with other kinds of models is that it's specifically concerned with so-called deep architectures. These are a model that stack multiple layers of representation and that is believed to lead to the model being able to learn more meaningful features as opposed to traditional shallow models like support vector machines, for example.\n\nIt's a field that has existed for a while actually. People have been trying to use deep neural networks since the 80s, I think, but it only started gaining some traction about 10 years ago, mostly because researchers have found mathematical tricks to optimize those models in an end-to-end way. And also thanks to the increasing availability of computational power, so really cloud computing.\n\n(03:26) Anytime I'm doing research around the history of AI, it's remarkable to see how long we've been using it, but have only just arrived at being able to maximize the technology. Let's talk a little bit about AI versus general artificial intelligence.\n\n(03:46) What we describe as a general artificial intelligence, sometimes is also called strong AI. It's the idea that a machine would be able to be trained and then, it would be able to learn any task that a human can learn.\n\nIt's more of an academic notion really, and I believe we're very far from that because we lack a lot of scientific knowledge about many mechanisms that underlie human intelligence and reasoning. The other kind of AI that you mentioned is the one that's been most successful, in my view. And people in academia typically refer to it as narrow AI.\n\nIt's the ability to really, for machines to mimic your very specific cognitive ability that's normally associated with humans, like speech for example, and in a way that is useful to us. This is mostly on the engineering side and most AI work in industry fall into that category. But that being said, a strong versus narrow AI or AI versus general AI, is really more of an academic debate in my view.\n\nThere's an article that was written last year by professor Michael Jordan from Berkeley, which I really liked, where he presented a framework to categorize different kinds of AI work in a way that is meaningful. I really encourage our listeners to take a look at it. It's called, Artificial Intelligence—The Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet. The three categories that he outlines, there are first what he calls the human imitative AI, which is mostly an academic field of work where people try to build an intelligence that somewhat resembles that of humans.\n\nThe second category is what he calls intelligence augmentation. And this is really an engineering domain that aims at augmenting human intelligence with things like web search, machine translation, and these are things that that really changed the way we interact with information.\n\nAnd the third category is called intelligent infrastructure. So everything around internet of things, sensors—these are basically systems that capture information about the world and try to make intelligent decisions based on that.\n\n(06:08) That really sounds like a crash course on AI, the way you've described it. I would love to know if you have any just examples of technology that isn't artificial intelligence. I know when you were describing kind of the difference between machine learning and AI, you talked a little bit about rule-based systems and I think often in movies media, AI is depicted as you know, anything smart is AI. Could you just share a few examples of technology that isn't AI? Maybe some things that are even commonly mistaken as AI?\n\n(06:49) Actually, I don't really want to single out a particular field because I think in every field there is room for research and development around something that is AI. I do want to point out that many fields of research and many fields of engineering are now called AI because as you say, the media talks a lot about it.\n\nEven practitioners in those domains are starting to talk about AI, but those domains often have a history of their own and most importantly, they have challenges and goals of their own. If you think, for example, the fields like data mining, like operations research, like control theory, even some parts of statistics for example.\n\nI don't think it's necessarily useful to call them out as AI in that sense because we can easily lose sight of what the goal of those disciplines is. For example, if you look at operations research, its goal really is to solve some very specific optimization problems in business. But if you call it an AI, it kind of blurs the notion of what the goal of that field is.\n\n(07:50)Well, thanks. Thanks for laying that out Frédéric. I'd love to talk more about your work at Sama, specific to our training data annotation platform.\n\n(08:02) Humans are much better than machines at recognizing and judging complex situations and use cases. Sama is a human-in-the-loop labeling platform where our customers can upload their data and receive annotations. We really want to make this platform more intuitive and more helpful to AI practitioners, in terms of tools that are available to slice and dice data sets, for example, to sample data sets for labeling. Because sometimes you have huge videos, but it's not exactly clear if you need to label the whole of it or whether you need to apply some smart way of just picking the frames that are important.\n\nWe support many types of annotation formats within that platform, but there are many features that are in the making, in my team, that will soon make their way into production.\n\n(08:57)Thanks for really pointing out that human-to-machine interaction. I think it often gets lost that humans help train AI. So thanks so much for pointing that out. Of the features that you're working on within the platform, how do you see that technology benefiting our customers at Sama?\n\n(09:21) So things like object detection and image segmentation in computer vision should really be an integral part of a data labeling solution. I think that what's really at the top of our team's list, in terms of priority is better quality in terms of annotation, and better efficiency. So that's really what we're looking to achieve. I believe customers can benefit from even better quality of our in-house labeling and also our ability to take on larger sets of data in a matter that is efficient and scalable. It's about being able to scale and also preserving the quality\n\n(10:06) In terms of limitations around AI—I read so much from McKinsey Global Institute, and I think it was last year, they shared a report of the top five limitations to adopt AI. Two of those common challenges are labeling training data and then obtaining datasets. How can Sama help with this? \n\n(10:28) Of course, Sama as a training data provider can of course help with this aspect, more profoundly, as machine learning and AI gain importance in technology, but also generally in our lives, so will the importance of those data sets and more specifically how those data sets are gathered, if you will.\n\nSo I think that beyond the core labeling services, providing expertise on data acquisition and data labeling not only in technical terms, but also from a social and ethical perspective is really essential and will be increasingly important as society evolves, and also as regulation evolves.\n\n(11:13) Well, in your opinion, Frédéric, how is AI shaping the world around us?\n\n(11:20) Oh wow. That's a really good and open question. I have a few ideas about it. Uh, of course, this is only a subset of all of the ways that I think the world will be shaped. But I think it's shaping the world in many ways and whether those ways are positive or negative are really dependent on how we make use of those advances.\n\nSo first from engineering perspective, I think it's really pushing the boundary of many fields that we thought really were more the realm of humans. For example, if we think of speech recognition, machine translation, and also computer vision, advances in AI have rendered those systems very close to human capability.\n\nWhile maybe 10 or 15 years ago that technology really wasn't there yet, and using these systems really felt still cumbersome. So in that sense, I think it's changing the way we interact with technology and the way we interact with information in general. From a social perspective, I think it's pushing a lot of automation and decision making, in ways that can be both good and bad.\n\nI think it can be very good because machines are much better than humans at making very large scale inferences and taking a lot of factors into account when making that decision leading to, you know, high quality decision systems. It can also be very bad, because if we give too much control to these systems without any human oversight, it can be dangerous. And, the nature of the data used to train these models will ultimately determine its performance.\n\nAlso, if you look at a system that's working in a given context and that's been trained in a given context, it may have unpredictable behavior if we slightly changed the context. So that can be also very dangerous.\n\nAnd finally, I think it's of course changing the dynamics of the job market. And the impact that will have on society is I guess in the realm of politics more than technology, but you know, how do we make the greater number of people benefit from the advances that are provided by AI.\n\n(13:40) Frédéric, 2020 is just around the corner and lots of reports are coming out on the state of AI. Are there any trends that you want to call out that we could expect to see in 2020 regarding AI?\n\n(13:58) There are many exciting fields right now that are progressing very, very quickly in AI, but I'd like to call out three things.\n\nI think in the last one or two years there's been a lot of progress in natural language processing. I think what happened in vision, you know, around 2015, 2016 is happening now in NLP because the accuracy of models is increasing quickly. So I think we can expect some more progress in that area in general.\n\nOf course human communication is not only based on words. I think to reach a really human level of understanding of semantics, we'll have to integrate other modalities like nonverbal communication, visual cues, etc. But there's still room for progress, just based on text.\n\nThe second thing I really find very interesting is causality, so the study of cause and effect between different co-variants and explainability, the ability to explain the why it model is making the prediction it's making will keep growing as a topic of interest. It's actually growing very fast right now, and on another level I think that another area that is a really, really interesting is lower resource machine learning.\n\nSo models that can function with energy constraints or size constraints. Because as we grow more conscious about the energetic and environmental impact with machine learning, there's been a couple of articles recently in various newspapers, so models that require less computing will become more popular.\n\nThis is overall a pretty positive trend I think. Not only because it's more environmentally friendly, but also because I think it puts less of an advantage on very large players in the industry that have an unlimited access to computing power.\n\n(16:01) For sure. So, are we talking at all about AI at the edge?\n\n(16:08) Yeah, we're seeing that a lot. On a lot of devices you can see that you have models that you run on the platform, and I think that's something that will only grow because there will also be more regulations pertaining to data exchange.\n\n(16:24) For sure. For sure. Well, is there anything else that stands out to you regarding the state of AI or any challenges with AI adoption?\n\n(16:34) I think there's a couple of things, but just to call out, two of them, you mentioned earlier the data labeling aspect that is difficult for organizations, but I think it goes deeper than that.\n\nI think even the raw data really is an issue because very often in various organizations, depending on their level of technical savviness, the raw data, if available even is often distributed across different departments and various formats, you know—Excel sheets, SQL databases, etc. So it's very difficult to actually take that data and even just do anything with it. I think that's a very big challenge that organizations really need to tackle.\n\nThe second aspect I wanted to call out is also the increasing debate on the use of data in many applications where massive data is collected from users. I think it's a very welcome debate because we're all aware of that regulation has somewhat been lagging behind in that respect, and it has led to a number of problematic situations. But, I think it will be very interesting to see how will the technologies be impacted by all of the new regulations with respect to data ownership and privacy.\n\n(17:50) It's been incredibly eye opening talking with you today, and I think my last question for you is just, what do you love most about working in AI?\n\n(18:02) Most definitely I think it's the ability to constantly work on new problems, and also the ability to really work with really smart and talented people all the time. I also enjoy really shaping a whole new engineering discipline. I think that's very exciting.\n\n\n\nThis interview is the second installment of a new audio blogging series titled, \"Ask Me Anything,\" where Sama interviews subject matter experts working in artificial intelligence.","seo_title":"8 Answers to Your Questions About AI and Machine Learning","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"8-answers-to-your-questions-about-ai-and-machine-learning"},"tags":[{"_key":"Y7bAcGrE","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"qhgHNaG5","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"0PqR2xB7","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"NoohHt2W","label":"Sama Engineering","value":"Sama Engineering"}],"title":"8 Answers to Your Questions About AI and Machine Learning"},{"_createdAt":"2019-11-19T19:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

Here are 4 reasons e-commerce needs AI to stay ahead.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"Serving a niche audience, personalization, cultivating strategic partnerships, or even cutting costs in your supply chain to pass on the savings are well-known ways e-commerce enterprises remain competitive.\n\nHowever, in an era where an agile operation is fast becoming the expectation, here are four reasons e-commerce needs artificial intelligence to stay ahead.\n\nImprove Accuracy and Efficiency in Your Supply Chain\n\nDemand planning already uses machine learning to incorporate data and insights like store traffic, weather forecasts and competitor pricing in supply chain operations, but AI can also help improve accuracy and efficiency in your supply chain in other ways. \n\nSince working together, Sama has improved Walmart’s item coverage from 91 percent to 98 percent.\n\nTraining Walmart’s systems meant manually cataloging and evaluating more than 2.5 million items, and while sharpening the supply chain with AI comes with its share of challenges, having a training data partner with a commitment to quality and security helped further Walmart’s machine learning initiatives. \n\n\n\nStreamline Business Operations\n\nAI can play an integral role in streamlining e-commerce operations. For example, Amazon uses artificial intelligence to make adjustments in delivery routes and arrival times.\n\nOther retailers like Gap are also using a combination of human effort and automation (https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18526092/amazon-warehouse-robotics-automation-ai-10-years-away) to perform dynamic product picking in shipping warehouses. \n\nResearch continues on how to fully automate shipping warehouses, but it’s this level of human-in-the-loop AI (https://www.sama.com/samahub-platform)that shows great promise for e-commerce enterprises.\n\nWorking together, humans and machines can find ways to deliver customer orders with efficiency, providing a stark competitive advantage to companies who adopt AI as part of their operational roadmap.\n\nPut Product Recommendations on Autopilot\n\nA product recommendation engine allows you to suggest products uniquely suited for your buyers. Think of this algorithm as the digital substitute for brick and mortar store clerks who guide shoppers to relevant and similar products.\n\nOur work with Walmart contributes to the accuracy of their product recommendations, and we’ve also helped Getty’s Images catalog stock photos based on key attributes, to support the foundation of its recommendation engine.\n\nRecommendation engines help you up-sell, cross-sell and otherwise inspire customers to bundle offers and create custom solutions best suited for their needs, and according to a McKinsey report, Amazon’s AI-powered recommendation engine was responsible for 35 percent (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) of the company's revenue. \n\nIn addition to product recommendations, artificial intelligence can automate post-purchase activities like accurately timed repurchasing messages, so your buyers are their most ready to buy.\n\nCreate Immersive Customer Experiences\n\nToday’s always-connected consumer shops from multiple devices, putting seamless customer experiences at the core of driving customer engagement.\n\nA recent study showed that about two-thirds of shoppers (https://www.emarketer.com/content/two-thirds-of-internet-users-check-phones-in-store-for-product-information-skipping-store-associates) check their phone in-store for product information e.g. looking up product reviews, comparing prices, etc. Whether it’s to send targeted and relevant messaging and ads, or to enable real-world product scanning, e-commerce needs AI, in order to create immersive customer experiences at scale. \n\nWhen we work with companies that want to use AI in e-commerce, we notice a few common barriers in AI adoption, such as a lack of training data strategy, lack of talent and/or platform to get started with AI and a lack of high-quality data to properly train AI algorithms.\n\nIf any of these barriers are stopping you from implementing AI across your organization, we can help. Helping e-commerce enterprises keep up with the demand for personalization, while driving the best level of digital classification, i.e., enabling the maximum/optimal experience for users to describe and see what they are shopping for, is what we do.\n\nContact us (https://www.samasource.com/contact-us) to learn more about accelerating your ML pipeline with high-quality training data from Sama.\n\n\n","seo_title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-compelling-reasons-to-use-ai-in-e-commerce"},"tags":[{"_key":"DCGPNa4P","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"KwAtlFPO","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"1uBvx190","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"Cryu3t8R","label":"E-Commerce","value":"E-Commerce"}],"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"},{"_createdAt":"2019-10-31T19:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

This addition of on-the-go shoe sizing further showcases a pivot across the e-commerce industry toward immersive customer experiences both online and offline.\n\n\n\n3 Benefits of AR in E-commerce\n\nImproved Shopping Experiences\n\nWith AR, e-commerce enterprises have an opportunity to remove online shopping objections like product fit from the equation, resulting in improved shopping experiences for buyers. Online shoe shopping is a prime example, given how shoe sizing can vary from one brand to another.\n\nThe Nike app is said to measure each foot \"within 2 millimeters of accuracy\" and suggest a size based on the style of shoe you’re looking at, which ideally takes the guesswork out of buying shoes online.\n\n\n\nIncreased Buyer Confidence\n\nA general consensus is that Nike shoes run small in most styles, making it difficult for new customers to buy into the brand sight unseen, while making existing advocates think twice about trying new styles from a brand they love. AR provides an avenue for shoppers to find their “perfect fit” whether it’s shoes, clothes, makeup, or even jewelry.\n\nTake Brilliant Earth for example. The company is widely known for its conflict free diamonds, and its mobile user experience for engagement ring shopping includes a virtual try on option powered by AR.\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Brilliant Earth’s AR toolkit in action.\n\n\n\nEven Shopify, a go-to e-commerce platform for established and aspiring brands has made the move to offer AR as a part of their seller toolkit.\n\nThis shows that engaging with shoppers is more than just proactive customer service and two-way conversations—it’s about increasing confidence among buyers by giving them a truer sense of the size, scale and detail of your product.\n\n\n\nHuman-to-Machine Enabled Product Improvements\n\nArguably the most exciting thing about Nike’s AR-enabled app is the potential for human-to-machine collaboration on product improvements.\n\nNike expressed it would be integrating what it learns about customer shoe size as a primary feature for measuring shoes. Over time, this could lead to production improvements based on cumulative measurement data from the app and purchase data from people with similar sized feet.\n\nYes—AR presents an exciting opportunity for the retail industry, but it also marks an era where humans and machines can work together to shape and mold the world around us.\n\nPHOTO: Nike App with AR via The Verge\n\n\n\nIn a time where a 90’s animated series can be turned into an AR-enabled game, and bring people together in droves, artificial intelligence can prove to be a unique competitive advantage.\n\nIn fact, 45 percent of consumers surveyed said they would try AR, and an additional 30 percent reported “they would never go to another clothing store again if AR would allow them to buy the right size clothing with confidence.”\n\nThe market opportunity for AR in e-commerce is promising, however, AI requires a solid foundation of data to be effective, and if that data quality is compromised, so are your algorithms.\n\nAccording to Mckinsey Global Institute, 1 out of 3 use cases for retraining AI systems requires a model refresh at least monthly, and sometimes daily.\n\nNike’s insistence on human-to-machine learning is a signal that continuously refreshed, quality data is needed in order to deliver on the personalized experiences expected of the retail industry.\n\nFor years, Sama has delivered turnkey, high-quality training data and validation to train the world's leading AI technologies.

There’s also a rising demand for vision-guided robotic systems and application-specific computer vision systems, alongside a growing adoption of 3D computer vision.\n\n\n\nA Fundamental Problem with Computer Vision\n\nBhargav Desai, Technical Writer and Instructor at Eduonix shares that deep learning itself is arguably the most fundamental problem with computer vision. The emphasis on its strengths while lacking acknowledgement for apparent weaknesses such as mistaking an overturned school bus for a snowplow is not just a mistake but a revealing mistake.\n\n“It not only shows that deep learning systems can get confused, but that they are challenged in making a fundamental distinction known to all us humans, the distinction between “understanding” the object and “seeing” an object,” Desai explains.\n\nComputer Vision as Part of the Shopping Experience\n\nThere’s a growing demand among consumers for more robust search options including visual and voice search. A recent survey found that over 60% of respondents would be comfortable with new technologies like the ability to search by image as a part of their digital shopping experience.\n\nProjected Market Growth in Computer Vision Solutions\n\nThe market for computer vision solutions is expected to reach over 17 billion U.S. dollars by 2023, which is indicative of the growing pace of research and advancements in computer vision.\n\nThe Growing Application of Computer Vision Systems\n\nEnterprises like DHL are using extended reality experiences like AR to boost accuracy in their business operations. The company is using AR glasses to display picking and placement directions to its operators, and this application of computer vision systems has led to a 15 percent average increase in productivity.\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama quickly trains and validates machine learning, download our solution brief for details on our project set-up and workflows, platform security and annotation tools for computer vision.","seo_title":"Computer Vision Insights From Around the Web","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"computer-vision-insights-from-around-the-web"},"tags":[{"_key":"gRBnMPo9","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"rxlxYiKX","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"kT5jCNe2","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"3o90fgFc","label":"Computer Vision","value":"Computer Vision"}],"title":"Computer Vision Insights From Around the Web"},{"_createdAt":"2019-09-26T23:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1fd7fbcc4633299cdbedddba22cb44e24f17317-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

Here are a few things to consider, to strengthen your data security practices.\n\nData Security Best Practices\n\n1. Limit Data Access\n\nLimiting data access based on those who actually need it can help minimize security risks. In addition to things like assigning access based on categories, you can implement infrastructure like a multi-tenant interface to assign roles according to the principle of least privilege.\n\nWe use role based access to ensure client data is only accessed by authorized employees who have a legitimate reason to access the information. For example, data trainers can only perform work, while supervisors can perform work, as well as sampling and QA tasks.\n\n2. Document Your Data Security Policy\n\nA data security policy outlines your organization’s commitment to protect the information you handle, as well as the security measures taken to protect said data.\n\nIf your business operates in or serves residents of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), include details of your data protection responsibilities according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our security and trust webpage features an overview of our data privacy and security policies. You can also download our datasheet to learn more.\n\n\n\n3. Data Encryption In Transit and At Rest\n\nWhen properly encrypted, even compromised data is inaccessible. Our directly managed workforce prepares work in ISO certified delivery centers, using our secure, training data annotation platform. We encrypt client data in transit and at rest, to protect it from unauthorized access from ingestion all the way through to delivery.\n\n4. Conduct Regular Audits\n\nIn addition to limiting data access, encrypting data and following industry-leading data security and privacy practices, consider doing regular audits to help keep your data secure. This could be done on a regular ongoing basis i.e., automated security scanning and pen-testing, in addition to annual or bi-annual checks that take a deeper dive into your infrastructure.\n\n\n\nData privacy and security are fundamental design requirements in our technologies, services, business practices and operations. We use a number of physical and logical security measures, including regular vulnerability testing, to protect client data.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about our annotation platform, download the Solution Brief or request a demo.","seo_title":"4 Things That Make a Difference in Data Security","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"https://www.sama.com/blog/4-things-that-make-a-difference-in-data-security"},"tags":[{"_key":"PJHsWYQd","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"n0lW8qhB","label":"Security \u0026 Trust","value":"Security \u0026 Trust"},{"_key":"hDx5GOGL","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"}],"title":"4 Things That Make a Difference in Data Security"}],"morePosts":[{"_createdAt":"2019-08-20T21:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

Read more about some of the challenges and trends in AI.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"Data isn’t the only thing holding back artificial intelligence. Factors like deciding where and how to deploy AI in business and public perception also play a role in the future of AI.\n\n\nChallenges in Artificial Intelligence\n\nThere’s still work to be done before achieving true intelligence. The gap between artificial intelligence and artificial general intelligence is wide. AI must first “learn to learn” in order to understand and perform intellectual tasks that can be done by humans. (MIT Technology Review)\n\nAI doesn’t always live up to its expectations. With over 50% of people getting their information on AI from movies and TV or social media, the high expectations of AI don’t live up to the hype surrounding it. (McKinsey Global Institute)\n\nPublic opinion of AI is tentative. Public opinion regarding the trustworthiness of AI is tentative. A recent survey found that 50% of consumers feel “optimistic and informed” about AI, while the other half feel “fearful and uninformed”. (Blumberg Capital)\n\nFalse positives and bias in data cause uncertainty. Datasets are curated based on human logic and values, making it difficult to completely rule out bias in the resulting ML model. (Sama)\n\nShortage of data and lack of infrastructure impede the AI pipeline. More companies are considering AI projects, but few have a process to bring projects to production. Enterprises lack the data and infrastructure to support smooth data flow from ingestion to algorithm, making it difficult to operationalize ML models and intelligence. (IDC)\n\nLabeling datasets is arguably the hardest part of building AI. Among other AI challenges like having a clear strategy to source the data that AI requires, organizations argue that the hardest part of building AI products is data preparation and labeling. (Inside Big Data)\n\nDifficulty explaining why a complex decision was reached. AI is programmed to learn by itself, and sometimes, it reaches decisions that no human can explain. We’ve seen this with Google DeepMind’s AlphaZero algorithm, and initiatives like Explainable AI (https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/01/10/darpa-xai-explainable-artificial-intelligence/)have developed to find answers to this problem. (Intercepting Horizons)\n\nFear that AI will negate the necessity of humans in the workforce. There’s a prevailing fear that AI will take over jobs previously performed by humans. However, AI has its limitations. The Future of Jobs report predicts how the division tasks between human and machine will shift between now and 2022. (World Economic Forum)\n\nGood talent is hard to find. Finding professionals that have the right skillset and experience for AI work is among the top challenges for enterprises who have piloted or embedded AI in their organization. (McKinsey Global Institute)\n\nAs new developments in AI occur, the societal and data challenges surrounding the technology will continue to shift and evolve. These challenges should not be overlooked, but rather carefully observed as we pursue human-level intelligence for AI.\n\n","seo_title":"What's Holding Back Artificial Intelligence?","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"whats-holding-back-artificial-intelligence"},"tags":[{"_key":"opg67GGB","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"zbe0rrVL","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"dV7VmzZT","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"What's Holding Back Artificial Intelligence?"},{"_createdAt":"2019-07-01T21:45:00Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

Also, there were many hardware technology companies developing sensors and cameras, as well as myriad providers of technology to make useful the vast data output from these sensors. (ICYMI - We are in the latter category).\n\n\n\nSee our Account Executive Steve Allen answer questions on camera… no pressure!\n\n\n\nA Keen Interest in Data Annotation\n\nWe spoke to many attendees, from both OEMs and sensor tech companies who were very curious about our offerings in the annotation space. They asked how we could annotate data sets, what kinds of data we could work with, and what makes Sama stand out from other options.\n\nOur differentiators in brief: there is great appreciation for the value of our skilled agents, as we can train them directly during pilot projects, leading to immediate and consistent quality output during the project; they are on staff and work in Sama-operated offices with structured supervision and project management; and our ISO 9001 certification was very appreciated.\n\nAnd the fact that we have a measurable social impact mission adds value to the company’s CSR departments. (Stay tuned for our upcoming blogs where we go into a little more detail on these aspects.)\n\nAutonomous Driving (AD) Tech Trends\n\nIt was notable that there were several speakers talking about the need for car/passenger interaction design. Some examples:\n\nAcknowledgement of the importance of the vehicle's ability to communicate to the passenger what objects the car is noticing and that influence self-driving decisions.\n\nExposing these decision hints visually will help people to gain trust in the AI and understand how it works. There is an intrinsic problem where it's really hard to explain why a neural network makes a given decision -- but this could help.\n\nThe awareness that autonomous vehicles need to take suggestions from the passenger on Spotify stations or travel route preferences, keep track of who is in the car, and have an internal sense of the state of the car (spilled coffee, forgotten phones).\n\nThere were many examples of the research around reading facial cues or what human commands or questions really mean.\n\nWhat this tells me is that the technology is getting to a more mature state where we can put effort into these secondary considerations are nonetheless necessary to making this technology viable and successful in the mainstream.\n\nThe conference ended with a demo from GM of a L2 autonomous system - currently available at a Caddy dealership near you. While not fully autonomous, the vehicle can take control on the highway and proactively vibrate seats and flash lights to keep drivers alert and engaged.\n\nThey also showed demo videos of their L4 autonomous Chevy Bolts fielded by the Cruise Automation subsidiary operating in San Francisco. Though there were passengers in the car who could take control if necessary, it was a compelling proof of concept in a denser, more dangerous environment with bicyclists and pedestrian traffic. GM/Cruise hasn’t officially announced when their automated ride hailing service will launch to the public, but it’s already operating in beta for San Francisco employees! In short, GM is demonstrating pretty rapid rapid development and growth.\n\n\n\nAn overview of some of the players that was shared at the conference. GM is leader of the pack. Navigant Research\n\nA company called Renovo Motors shared their vision of an OS for self-driving taxis - tying together a coalition of technologies around the projected $1 trillion “robotaxi” marketplace. They make bold, exciting predictions that by 2030, 95% of all urban miles will be driven by autonomous taxis.\n\nA trend worth watching - “multitasking networks.” These autonomous driving algorithms are able to run different perception routines in parallel and switch between them as desired for changing environments or scenarios. For example, you might have one algorithm that's controlling the car while you're in clear daylight conditions. A little helper algorithm detects that you’ve driven into a fog bank (as I do every morning when crossing the Golden Gate Bridge!), and the car may switch to a different control algorithm optimized for fog navigation.\n\nCombining this multitasking with interest in “sensor fusion” definitely shows that there's a need for multimodal sensor data and more sophisticated algorithms to operate in transient situations.\n\nSama Commitment to Best Annotation Technology\n\nWe continuously look for the data types that are of interest to our customers. There is so much data needed for 2D and Video annotation technology that we can support. We also heard a lot of interest around Lidar 3D technology. Look for future reports from the field on this blog.\n\nAs head of product for Sama, I can tell you we are always looking to how we can incorporate emerging data sources into our platform to provide rapid, high quality annotation. If there’s one thing the Sama journey has shown, it’s that the benefit of a skilled workforce is their flexibility and adaptability to varied tasks with uncompromising quality.\n\nI think that puts us in a very good position as new sensor data becomes more important for more sophisticated algorithms. I feel very confident we're going to be able to build those workflows into our platform and train up our workforce to deliver.\n\nIf you’d like to learn any more about our capabilities and approaches to supporting your data needs in this area, we would urge you to download our solution brief about our Annotated Data Sets. We look forward to joining you in this adventure unfolding on the the roads of the world.","seo_title":"Takeaways from AutoAI Conference 2018","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"takeaways-from-autoai-conference"},"tags":[{"_key":"2fZXZfik","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"bS0jYOSG","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"hKUrqBWv","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"Takeaways from AutoAI Conference 2018"},{"_createdAt":"2017-03-21T20:31:18Z","author":{"_id":"ba12f1d5-b083-4eb7-929d-7e1639ef64c5","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1fd7fbcc4633299cdbedddba22cb44e24f17317-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Daniele is a Sales Operations and Engineering Senior Manager for Sama working with teams in EMEA and APAC.","name":"Daniele Packard","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"daniele-packard"}},"estimatedReadingTime":4,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e7af72154b4cdac45f8526a3934f9ac612e23d37-513x321-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"meta_description":"3 Computer Vision Applications You Haven't Heard Of... Yet","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"From the looming reality of fully autonomous vehicles to a farmer in Japan using TensorFlow to sort cucumbers, computer vision machine learning is becoming an increasingly accessible and ubiquitous phenomenon. As a service provider in this space, Sama has a unique view into the breadth of computer vision applications. While certain applications of machine learning are prevalent in mainstream media (e.g. autonomous vehicles), there are equally interesting and lesser-known applications that are similarly revolutionary:\n\n\n\n1. Environmental\n\nSatellites orbiting the earth have been collecting comprehensive image data sets of the globe for decades. With recent advancement in computer vision, these images can be efficiently and automatically combed for valuable information. By applying deep learning models to sets of satellite imagery, companies like Orbital Insight can extract data on global surface water levels, informing communities, planners, and policymakers in making critical decisions about water resources.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 San Luis Reservoir. Left: Raw image. Middle: Landsat 8 water mask. Right: Orbital insight water mask. Orbital Insights, 2015\n\n\n2. Biomedical\n\nImage analysis in the medical field is a time-consuming process; using computer vision machine learning to automate portions of this analysis could help make the process more efficient and less costly for the general public. A bottleneck to progress in this field has been the lack of training data, which requires specialists to create (though there’s evidence that specialists can be substituted by pigeons!) and the data is typically confidential. The availability of large datasets with diagnostic labels, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), has paved the way for new applications, using computer vision machine learning to provide early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n\n3.Agricultural\n\nThe advancement of drone and computer vision technology has both lowered the cost of gathering huge sets of aerial imagery, and also increased our ability to intelligently extract information from that imagery. These technologies together can help farmers identify crop diseases or predict crop yields, automating a process where the alternative was manual inspection. In collaboration with Paul Allen towards his Great Elephant Census project, Sama facilitated the creation of a computer vision machine learning model used to track and count elephants as a part of anti-poaching efforts.\n\n\n\nElephant Sanctuary in Kenya, Sama, 2016\n\nUltimately applications of computer vision machine learning are limited only by human imagination. We look forward to seeing what applications this evolving technology will create, and are thrilled to count ourselves as part of this thriving community.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the future of practical computer vision, please join us at the Embedded Vision Summit, being held in Santa Clara from May 1-3. It’s the preeminent event for anyone adding computer vision capabilities to their products. We’ll be participating in the Vision Technology Showcase and invite you to stop by our booth.\n\nThe event is designed to inspire you to use vision technology in new ways and to empower you with the practical know-how you need to integrate vision capabilities into your products. Over three days and four tracks, you’ll meet innovators, luminaries, and colleagues in this fast-growing field.\n\nSama Sales team at Embedded Vision Summit, 2016","seo_title":"3 Computer Vision Applications You Haven't Heard Of...Yet","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"3-computer-vision-applications-you-havent-heard-of-yet"},"tags":[{"_key":"zGqHljfi","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"QcKBgjbl","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"mpmDlNYK","label":"Computer Vision","value":"Computer Vision"}],"title":"3 Computer Vision Applications You Haven't Heard Of...Yet"}],"slug":"ai","tagName":"AI","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/tag/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ai"},"buildId":"202899f50319881aba98bacba98f348defc1a075","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
