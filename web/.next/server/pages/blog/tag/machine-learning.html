And with 80% of AI project time being spent training the large volume of data necessary to train a model, efficiency improvements early on in the process are sure to have compounding effects.\n\nAt Sama, we have a dedicated Machine Learning team working at the forefront of AI research to identify optimization opportunities just like this, so we can develop advanced annotation tools to smooth the path to production for our clients. One of the papers the team presented at last year’s CVPR—Human-Centric Efficiency Improvements in Image Annotation for Autonomous Driving—shared an approach to speeding up polygonal instance segmentation using ML.\n\nToday, this technology has been incorporated into our platform to make our clients’ labeling process more efficient.\n\nWe call it ML Assisted Annotation powered by our MICROMODEL technology, and it’s already helping clients predictably get higher quality training data in half the time.\n\nRead on for an overview of ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology how it can help you develop models that are more scalable, robust and accurate – and can be brought into production more quickly.\n\nWhat is ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology?\n\n\nML Assisted Annotation (MAA) powered by MICROMODEL technology is an architecture that allows Sama to expedite the labeling process by drawing from a library of models trained on specific use cases. MAA can be used to generate high-quality pre-labeled annotations, which annotators validate to help them continuously improve over time.\n\nThis powerful combination of skilled annotators and an AI-powered platform allows us to deliver a high standard of label quality to our customers every time, along with efficiency improvements and quicker time to market.\n\nHow it works\n\nIn order to understand how MAA works, we first need to discuss the DEXTR model. DEXTR, or “Deep Extreme Cut,” is a publicly available object segmentation model for images and videos. \n\n\n\nWe’ve outlined the DEXTR model and our approach in detail in this post.\n\n\n\nMany ML methods like DEXTR have been suggested to speed up the process of instance segmentation, but these are not typically tested in a high-scale production environment, nor are ML outputs easily edited by human annotators. This makes it difficult to confidently reach the label quality standards required to run a model in production.\n\nMAA combines the well-known DEXTR approach with a raster-to-polygon algorithm to make results easily editable by a human in the loop. We’ve found that this approach—which pairs skilled annotators with ML-powered automation—significantly increases labeling efficiency and quality.\n\nLet’s see what that looks like in practice, using an example from the Autonomous Vehicle industry.\n\nMachine-Assisted Polygon Annotation\n\n\n\nWhen an annotator logs into the Sama annotation platform, they are presented with this workspace. In this example, the workspace is customized to allow the annotator to draw instance segmentation polygons around each of these vehicles:\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that there are several vehicles in this image. In a manual context, it could take a human several hours to deliver high-quality annotations of every single vehicle:\n\nWhat the manual annotation process would look like (sped up significantly): several clicks are required to draw a polygon around each of the vehicles.\n\n\n\nThis process is significantly accelerated with Machine-Assisted Polygon Annotation.\n\nThe model allows the annotator to use a crosshair tool to identify only four extreme points: left, right, top and bottom boundaries. These four clicks are the only inputs needed to create a heat map that is then sent to the inference server, returning an accurate prediction of a raster mask.\n\n\n\nWith Machine-Assisted Polygon Annotation, annotators only need to perform four clicks to produce an accurate raster mask prediction.\n\n\n\nMachine-Assisted Polygon Editing\n\n\n\nA polygon prediction can then be further refined by an annotator by switching into editing mode. This enables annotators to label precisely and ensure that high-quality requirements are met without compromise.\n\n\n\nIn this example, the raster mask prediction is edited by the annotator to ensure precise and high-quality labels.\n\n\n\nThis mode also enables annotators to use more than four extreme points in order to produce even more accurate predictions. A fifth user input point can easily be added, with the model immediately incorporating the new input to update its prediction.\n\nIf an ML model struggles to identify specific shapes, annotators can add a few more inference points to help result in a more accurate prediction, and then refine that prediction manually to ensure high-quality labels.\n\nResults from ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology\n\n\nOur clients are already seeing impressive results from MAA powered by MICROMODEL technology:\n\nPredictably producing 94-98% IOU (Intersection over Union) accuracy\nBecause our models are pre-trained on specific use cases for better performance out of the gate, our clients are seeing a quicker time to accuracy.\n\n2-4x more efficient annotation process\nYou can clearly see above that using MAA over a more manual polygon labeling approach results in significant time savings. But it’s also an iterative process with a human annotator in the loop; modifications to the predictions get fed back into the training data pipeline to retrain the model, enabling it to perform better predictions over time.\n\n\nQuicker time to market\nThe end result for our clients is faster iterations and a quicker time to market. A more efficient annotation process results in more data returned quickly, and ultimately a significantly shorter path to production.\n\nWhat’s more: increasing the efficiency of this labor-intensive manual data annotation process reduces the barrier to entry for more ML teams... and not just those with large R\u0026D budgets. Technology like this can also help democratize data labeling by driving down cost, so we can see even more deserving companies leverage AI to drive value for their business.\n\nSmall teams who are getting started with labeling may not have yet defined what type of annotations they need, or how much data they need to be successful. MAA can help them iterate more quickly, developing models in short increments rather than in large, cumbersome workstreams. The end result is a quicker time to value, and ultimately, to market — for organizations of all shapes and sizes.\n\nLearn more about ML Assisted Annotation powered by MICROMODEL technology by watching our recent webinar here, or reading more about it here.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"ml-assisted-annotation-micromodels"},"tags":[{"_key":"giPx682h","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"JOgmW0AV","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"45fExC0n","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"ML Assisted Annotation Powered by MicroModels"},{"_createdAt":"2021-06-22T15:12:25Z","author":{"_id":"f972de8a-10c1-45e3-97c9-ac490eaceabe","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4aa17073cfd70d2e8f7d8ed85325c14cb1519577-692x691-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Loic has over 20 years of industry experience in the Cloud services and AI industry.

But succeeding in a field as nascent as AI requires more than just bright minds and an ambitious roadmap.\n\n\n\nA key ingredient to success – and one that is often overlooked – is a mindset of experimentation; a culture that encourages teams to solve issues in new and more efficient ways. Early on, we found that our teams thrive in this kind of environment, which is why this week, we’re wrapping up our third Innovation Week. \n\nThe concept is simple: for one week, anyone can work on a project they feel passionate about. During the week, you have free rein to work on whatever you please in whichever way you choose. There are no meetings and no interruptions. You are free to try new things, invent and learn. You can be part of a team or single-handedly run with your ideas.\n\nThis year, some exciting highlights include:\n\nA more efficient approach to video tracking and segmentation\n\nNew Smart Polygon tool that is able to greatly increase annotation efficiency\n\nEnhancing our platform through the introduction of a Sama CLI and data pre-processing capabilities\n\nThe atmosphere is incredible. The week starts with a kickoff, where everyone can present the problem they are trying to solve and how they are planning to solve it. The closing ceremony is called the “Grand Reveal,” where each individual or group demos what they worked on. It sometimes yields incredible presentations... other times, it doesn't.\n\nFreedom breeds creativity. These events have brought some of the most core and innovative components of our platform. Last year, over 50% of all Innovation Week projects were incorporated into our roadmap and implemented within the following two quarters. A perfect example of this is our MicroModel technology, which was initially borne from one of these projects. We now use this technology for Machine Assisted Annotation for deployments in the automotive and e-commerce industries.\n\nNot only does the event enhance our product, it also attracts talent. This year, we doubled our R\u0026D team and are continuing to grow.\n\nInnovation Week gives our R\u0026D team the space to do what they do best: observe, experiment and discover.\n\nInnovation Week is coming to a close, and once more, our teams have given us plenty to be excited about. As always, many of the projects are slated to appear on our platform. In particular, we saw lots of work around our new 3D LiDAR annotation automation and data processing… stay tuned for that.\n\nAt Sama, Innovation Week is designed to encourage experimentation by allowing teams to shift the focus from our immediate customer’s needs to a broader, more bold approach to Machine Learning.

MIT has defined ‘human-centered AI’ as “the design, development, and deployment of systems that learn from and collaborate with humans in a deep, meaningful way”. Therefore, to become less ‘human-centered’, you would need an AI landscape in which smart algorithms do all the heavy lifting. We asked experts working in the field about their thoughts on the role of humans in Machine Learning, and humans and the future of ML.\n\nRemo, Senior Software Engineer at Apple, states: “ML as a part of software engineering is by definition human-centric. It is human-centric because it substitutes the work of humans. For example in the recommendation of music, the identification of spam, or in object recognition. ML is human-centric because it is often (or almost always) trained on human generated or at least labeled data. And it is human-centric because ML models are built and designed on top of people's inductive biases about the world. At the same time it is not human (or human centric) because it does not reason or think. It spots patterns but does not \"connect the dots.\" \n\nIndu Khatri, the Machine Learning Lead at financial giant HSBC echoed the point above: “I would break down ML problems into three parts. The first one being identifying the problem to which ML needs to be applied and defining a broad architecture about how ML models will solve the problem. The second stage is developing the ML models and the third stage is taking actions based on ML models, getting the feedback from your environment and improving the models further. Out of these three stages, I believe Stage one will always need some kind of human intervention. With the advent of AutoML the amount of human intervention is decreasing everyday. Finally, for decreasing the amount of human intervention in Stage three we would need to improve the sample efficiency of Reinforcement Learning so that our Models can map predictions to actions in a feasible way.”\n\nConversely, Staff ML / NLP Research Scientist at Stanford and former Senior Research Scientist at Uber AI, Piero Molino, suggested that moving away from a human-centric model would be a mistake. “I believe there are several friction points that can be automated, like the data/model interface, the model search, evaluation and monitoring, Ops in general. But what I would rather wish is for ML to become more human-centric in the sense that it should put more humans at the center of its strategy rather than increased efficiency, and that is achieved with more humans in the loop evaluation and data generation processes, more robustness and more fairness evaluations.”\n\nData Scientist at Gartner, Lavi Nigam, thinks we’re already fairly close to an AutoML model, which as the name suggests, would mean far less human-interaction needed. So much so, that we could only be a few years away from this coming to fruition. “When more and more intrinsic pieces of data science workflows are automated mathematically and programmatically. We already see AutoML models that can figure out the best model for your data with any constraint defined. As the AutoML advances, we will eventually see that human interference in model building will greatly reduce and result in more optimized models. Deployment automation and Model Tracking (both part of MLOps) are other areas of focus where human involvement will drastically reduce in the coming years.”\n\nShuo Zhang, Senior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation, agreed that we’re fairly close to an ML model which requires little human interaction. “There are many current techniques that make ML algorithms less dependent on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large amounts of data, such as self supervision and unsupervised techniques.”\n\nTwo other experts we asked agreed that ML as a concept requires human intervention. Removing this wouldn’t be beneficial and could actually be the opposite. Jason Gauci, a Software Engineering Manager at Facebook stated that “ML should work hand-in-hand with people, not replace them or automate the things that they do without oversight.” This was somewhat echoed by Sean Xie, Director of AI at Pfizer: “Current technologies are still focused on solving narrowly defined and specific problems. There’s a long way to go to be less human-centric.”\n\nIf we were to move toward an AutoML/less human-centric model, how could it be done? Yaman Kumar, PhD Computer Science at the University of Buffalo suggested that you would need to “join forces with the philosophy, metaphysics and ethics department and see the field adopting human-centric vision right, left and centre. As long as both AI and philosophy departments are cutoff and work in their own silos, things will go on as-is. Recent times have shown green shoots where more and more people from philosophy backgrounds are entering the field and guiding key areas such as fairness in ML.”","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-to-think-about-human-centered-machine-learning"},"tags":[{"_key":"pOB3rwcB","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"v412ROa8","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"Experts Explain: How to Think About Human-Centered Machine Learning"},{"_createdAt":"2021-03-29T21:29:09Z","author":{"_id":"785c9b8f-1869-4ce3-9eaa-c53945aa9736","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-c187f0a84bc4d1a6870d3a7a8528f242920a33aa-309x343-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Aurelie Drouet leads Product Marketing at Sama.

It's been predicted that 87% of AI projects will never make it into production. Why? We asked ML experts what they believe to be the main reasons that ML projects fail.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nA disconnect between the science and real-world application of the ML solutions and business expectations.\n\nUnreasonable expectations from business hierarchies on both the outcome and cost of many ML projects .\n\nAiming to develop MLOps without due diligence and research into some of the challenges that could be faced along the way .\n\nTo make an ML project successful, we need to find the right problem, use the right data, and develop the right method. Many ML projects do not meet these three requirements.\n\nIt’s not easy for companies to find enough data to run useful and high quality ML models.\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam\nData Scientist, Gartner\n\n“The biggest reason for project failure is ML processes maturity. There are too many moving and distinct pieces in ML/DL workflows and they are not mostly tied intrinsically by a single tool/framework. Enterprises and open source projects are trying to bridge this gap and I feel in the next 3 years we will see good progress in this area. Open source end-to-end MLOps are very important since they will help with wider adoption just like Tensorflow did for deep learning. Another big issue which increases project failure is that currently data science is evolving and has not reached ‘enterprise ready consensus’ with regards to set practices for different domains.”\n\n\n\nSparkle R. \nAssociate Director Data Science, Johnson \u0026 Johnson\n\n“ML projects still fail because of the disconnect between the science and real-world application of the ML solutions and business expectations. We are now in a society that prefers to use the word ML to demonstrate prestige despite having no clear impact. While there are many other reasons that can contribute to a ML project’s failure, the major factors include: a lack of high-quality data, poorly designed research questions, overly optimistic business expectations and a disconnect between the developers, product owners, data scientist and the ML-based system end users.”\n\n\n\nRemo Storni\nSenior Software Engineer, Apple\n\n“The biggest reason for ML project failures are unreasonable expectations about what is possible and unreasonable optimism about the project. People have trouble expecting the unexpected. There are a number of ML projects that fail and often these are problems that ML can't easily solve properly right now like conversational AI. There is a much bigger number of problems where ML falls short of expectations or where the project hits unexpected data or engineering problems.”\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal \nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n\n“I think this happens because people don’t do enough prep work before starting the project. It doesn’t make sense to apply a deep learning model where a logistic regression can do the trick. So, HOMEWORK before starting the project is very critical for the success of any ML project”.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\nStaff ML / NLP Research Scientist, Stanford University\n\n\"Because of the uncertainty baked in many parts of the machine learning development process. It is very difficult to assess beforehand if a machine learning project will succeed without analyzing the data, training initial models, evaluating them and then iterating. Product teams still don't know if there's enough signal in the data to begin with, how much data would they need, how expensive annotating it would be, and in many cases they don't have great ways to monitor and evaluate models. All these uncertainty sources, together with wrong expectations, may lead to failure of ML projects.\"\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh\nMachine Learning Lead, Apple\n\n“There are a variety of reasons ML projects fail. Sometimes ML projects are initiated without synergy on expectations, objectives, and success criteria of the project between the business and ML teams. There could be other reasons ranging from lack of expected data, expertise, limitations in the technology itself for certain domains. This is a long-term investment \u0026 hence clear strategy and leadership support are necessary for success.”\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\n\n“Many projects fail because people don't trade off the benefit of success with the consequence of failure. Imagine a smart garage door opener that could open your garage door in anticipation of your arrival. If it opens when you want, it saves a button press. But if it opens when you aren't around, someone can rob your house. Because of this extreme tradeoff, the model needs to be impossibly accurate because it's competing with a button press that is almost 100% accurate”\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\n\n“Most people just tried to find nails with an existing hammer. To make an ML project successful, we need to find the right problem, use the right data, and develop the right method. Many ML projects do not meet these three requirements. There is also miscommunication between the ML scientists and domain experts. It is not easy to find enough data to train the model. New methods need to be developed based only on the problem and available data.”\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri \nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n\n“Most ML projects fail because of a lack of understanding among the Business Executives about how ML models apply to their business. This usually leads to ML teams not solving the right problem for the business and underwhelming results. I have heard about projects that are stuck in research because of unclear problem statements.”\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\n\n“Projects failing in ML, in my opinion, is chiefly due to three reasons: under-specification, over-expectation and clean toy datasets. While most of our datasets are so clean that the models trained on them hardly work in the real conditions, the ones that do are marred by the hype surrounding AI and ML. Underspecification normally comes from a lack of maturity in the field.”","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-experts-biggest-roadblocks-ml-production"},"tags":[{"_key":"fLUi1ttd","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"1iCuMNwM","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"10 Experts on the Biggest Roadblocks to Bringing ML Models to Production"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-22T23:06:59Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

We partnered with our friends from RE•WORK by asking a range of experts in Machine Learning what they believe will be the next big thing. \n\n\n\nTushar Chugh\n\nMachine Learning Software Engineer, Google\nTushar’s predictions for 2021 are very much based on the outcome of work already underway. The former General Motors trailblazer suggested that he was on the lookout for the following in 2021: 1. The “rapid” training, evaluation and productionization for the large sequence models (such as GPT-3, T5). 2. The research towards developing giant ML models that can cater to multi-model inputs from various tasks and that can generalize well to the new tasks.\n\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\n\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\nWith over 17 years at Pfizer working in AI, Sean has overseen tasks ranging from quantification of MRIs to multivariate analysis of disease progress and most recently, a global effort in drug safety assessments. When asked what he thought might be on the horizon for this year, Sean suggested “We may train the machine to predict the Machine Learning in 2021.” This rather funny response, if true, could see a move toward the automation in ML we have discussed for some years.\n\n\n\nAlireza Rostamzadeh\n\nData Science \u0026 Machine Learning, Apple\nAlireza’s predictions for the year ahead were quite something, and we love the sound of this! “2021 will be the year when we start to see more tangible ML-driven products; from significant improvements in self-driving cars to a wave of new products based on augmented reality”.\n\n\n\nShuo Zhang \n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Bose Corporation\nWorking across NLP, Deep Learning and now ML, Shuo has a range of experience. When asked, Shuo suggested that while the question in itself is extremely broad, “I'd say that less dependence on human supervision by leveraging the intrinsic structures of large data is a path ML research is heading toward.” A step closer to the infamous automation buzzword.\n\n\n\nJason Gauci\n\nSoftware Engineering Manager, Facebook\nJason’s experience has spanned creative positions at Apple, Google and now Facebook, where he is working on a scalable reinforcement learning platform. When we asked Jason what he thought we could see in ML this year, he suggested “I predict that decision making AI will surge in popularity. Imagine an AI system that can tune constants in your code, or one that monitors your diet and suggests food. We have done a lot in the realm of signal processing but decision making continues to be an area with a lot of engineering trial-and-error.”\n\n\n\nSadid Hasan\n\nSenior Director of AI, CVS\n“In 2021, researchers would continue to take a leap in developing complex AI applications related to natural language understanding and generation by leveraging the ongoing advancements in multi-modal (text, speech, image) data fusion-based algorithms and more efficient transformer architectures. In addition, powerful synthetic data generation and augmentation techniques would enhance effective training of machine learning models by alleviating the challenges related to accessing sufficient ground-truth data. We would also see further emphasis on AI model’s ethicality, generalizability, explainability, and reproducibility along with efficient model Ops for a beneficial and robust on-device deployment. Furthermore, with the ongoing proliferation of healthcare data, the AI community would continue to build novel machine learning-based healthcare applications leading to increased AI adoption for providing meaningful decision-making support to end-users.”\n\n\n\nLavi Nigam \n\nData Scientist, Gartner\n“As more and more companies are heading towards AI/ML Maturity and working with more production scale ML/DL deployments, their focus in 2021 will be more on MLOps where they need to work on key aspects of processes like - Model/Data Drift Analysis, Model Interpretability, Data Governance, Model Scaling \u0026 AutoML. This year we will finally see many maturity models and practices for ML/DL operations coming up from different vendors and companies which will be very crucial in the long run.”\n\n\n\nBeat Raphael Schaad\n\nSenior Data Scientist, Sky\nThe Senior Data Scientist at Sky when asked his predictions for 2021 stayed very much on the hot topic of COVID. “The goal for 2021 is that Data can support governments beyond counting Covid19 cases and death rates. Given the recent events ML will have to improve massively in inference and causality issues. Forecasting methods using AI do not deliver anything on our historic events scenarios mainly because of the lack of explainability of the generated features.”\n\n\n\n\nIndu Khatri\n\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n2021 will be the Year of MLOps. Many cloud services such as GCP's AI Platform, AWS's Sagemaker have matured over the past years and are readily adaptable by ML teams. In 2021 and beyond Data Scientists would have to work collaboratively with DEs/MLEs to take their beautiful models from lab to production and realize business value.\n\n\n\nPiero Molino\n\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\nThe former Senior ML practitioner at UBER, currently makes up part of Professor Chris Ré's Hazy Research group on ML systems in California. Piero suggested that in industry he believes “models will start to come closer instead of being in separate silos like it happens today in most cases. In academia, I believe there will be more research focused on robustness and generalization.”\n\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi \n\nResearch Assistant, University of Florida\n“The year 2020 has significantly changed our lives in many ways. The way we work, communicate and learn has been impacted in many significant ways. Artificial Intelligence continues to be a key technology trend when it comes to the things that will change how we live, work, and play in the near future. I predict that artificial intelligence will be the main technology in the following areas: If any threat such as COVID were to occur, then that should be detected ahead of time. To help businesses prepare for situations like this pandemic, we must understand how users behave during such an emergency.”\n\n\n\nDivya Sivasankaran\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer, Autodesk\n\"Over the last year, we've seen a lot of local AI startups being sold/acquired. Many are struggling to bring AI products to market. I believe the pandemic merely sped up the inevitable. The silver lining to me here is that we've managed to cut down on the hype (noise) giving us time and resources to focus on impact with tangible applications (signal). That's why I think 2021 will be the year we will start to see AI/ML features in production for real - i.e., AI will successfully make the transition from being a spice to a core ingredient.\"\n\n\n\nRavi Dalal\n\nSenior Computer Vision Engineer, Walmart\n“I think 2020 has changed the world around us in many ways, and the retail sector is no exception. The pandemic has taught everyone new ways of shopping whether it's online, curbside pickup or concierge services for senior members. And AI/ML has played a major role in shaping all these solutions everywhere. Going in 2021, I feel rather than quantity of data, the market will shift towards the quality of data being captured. As more and more data points are getting captured to make better ML models; need of the hour is to make light weight models that can run on edge devices to filter and capture just the meaningful data. I call it -- \"AI/ML for Intelligent Data collection.”\n\n\n\nShaina Raza\n\nResearch Assistant, Ryerson University\nShaina, a former lecturer and now Research Assistant in ML gave one of the more exciting predictions on the list, which would mean large scale change and positive development in the field in the months to come. “Machine Learning is going to be easier, cheaper and beyond the limitations. The exponential power of the computing resources will be in the hands of laymen, and we see the revolution of the world much more earlier than expected.”\n\n\n\nYaman Kumar\n\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\nYaman’s research in ML revolves around Adversarial Networks, Interpretability, QA and Speech and is supported by Google doctoral Fellowship. Yaman simply suggested three compartments of ML which he believes will develop rapidly in 2021. “Unsupervised Learning, Explainability, and Fairness in ML.” Surprisingly, it was the only mention of unsupervised learning, which has seen to become somewhat of a buzzword at the backend of 2020.\n\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\n\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems \u0026 Strategy Lab\nI feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\n\n\n2021 is set to be uncertain in many ways. However, as with last year, hard work behind the scenes in AI and ML continues.

Although published at varying points in the development of Deep Learning and Machine Learning, each book offers unique insights. It was near impossible to narrow the list to just ten, but we couldn’t look past those below.\n\n\n1. Grokking Deep Learning\nAndrew W Trask (2009)\n\nGrokking Deep Learning is suggested to be a perfect place to delve into the subset of Machine Learning, not only describing and explaining APIs and frameworks, but also talking the reader through how they can actually build algorithms from scratch. This hands-on style of writing will help you build an AI capable of beating you in a classic game of Atari and Neural Networks capable of understanding basic images. While this is not a beginners guide, experience with calculus is not required, merely a high school level of mathematical understanding.\n\n2. The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book\nAndriy Burkov (2019)\n\nAn all you need to know guide to Machine Learning in just 100 pages, what more could you need? The Director of Data Science at Gartner, Andriy, suggests that you are a mere read of this book away from being ready to build complex AI systems, pass an interview or start your own business. Also available on Kindle, the 2019 release covers gradient descent, cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction and more. Is it for you? Andriy suggests that it is suitable for those both working in the field and those dipping their toe to find out more about the increasingly complex field of Machine Learning.\n\n\n3. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists\nSarah Guido \u0026 Andreas C. Mueller (2016)\n\nAlthough released in 2016, this 400 word bible for Machine Learning gives a great grounding in the basics of ML, providing a thorough and hands-on approach to Python use in ML. Learn not only what the most important concepts and algorithms are, but also when and how to use them. Imperative topics including machine learning workflow: data preprocessing and working with data are covered, as well as training algorithms, evaluating results, and implementing those algorithms into a production-level system\n\n\n4. Machine Learning For Absolute Beginners: A Plain English Introduction\nOliver Theobold (2017)\n\nA curveball, maybe, as we realize that those reading this list may have experience in the field, however, Machine Learning for Absolute Beginners walks through ML history and works in plain english with no coding experience necessary. What exactly will you be learning? The very basics including, decision trees, regression analysis, data reduction, k-means and more, giving you a great underlying understanding of the building blocks used in Machine Learning and how they can be used. Finally, some career advice with Oliver talking you through career options and how best to utilize the ML knowledge just picked up post-read.\n\n\n5. Mathematics for Machine Learning\nMarc Peter Deisenroth (2020)\n\nThis textbook puts the normally disparate course style of teaching in Mathematics to shame, combining together all of the fundamental mathematical tools needed to understand machine learning, including linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, optimization, probability and statistics. These concepts are then used to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines, giving a brilliant starting point for those entering the field and those looking for a refresher. Alongside the textual information, this book also includes examples and tests to ensure the reader's understanding.\n\n\n6. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\nChristopher M. Bishop (2007)\n\nChristopher Bishop’s Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. The first of its kind on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint, uses graphical models to describe probability distributions, which at the time, was not evident in any other ML text. Unlike some of the other inclusions on this list, familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential.\n\n\n7. Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques\nDaphne Koller \u0026 Nir Friedman (2009)\n\nA general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions. This book isn’t for beginners, nor for the faint of heart as it dives right into probabilistic graphical models in detail, including Bayesian and Markov Networks, inference, and learning from complete / incomplete data. If you want to get the most out of this book, there’s an option to attend Daphne Koller’s lectures on Probabilistic Graphical Models at Stanford University, on Coursera. Fun fact, Koller is actually one of the founders of Coursera, an online education platform.\n\n\n8. Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective (Net Developers)\nSergios Theodoridis (2015)\n\nThe book builds carefully from the basic classical methods to the most recent trends of the time, including chapters on pattern recognition, statistical/adaptive signal processing, statistical/Bayesian learning, as well as short courses on sparse modeling, deep learning, and probabilistic graphical models. All of the major techniques you’ll need to know prior to working in the field are covered, including Mean/Least-Squares regression and filtering, Kalman filtering, stochastic approximation and online learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, logistic regression and boosting methods. Alongside all of the theoretical text, this book includes case studies, code to be experimented with and more.\n\n\n9. Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective\nKevin P. Murphy \u0026 Francis Bach (2012)\n\nKevin describes this text as a comprehensive introduction to machine learning methods that use probabilistic models and inference as a unifying approach. This overview text combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Alongside this, the software platforms used in examples are freely available online. Unlike some of the other texts in this list, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective is suitable for upper-level undergraduates, giving an ideal introduction to ML and Mathematical formulas.\n\n\n10. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems\nAurelien Geron (2019)\n\nIn the last few years, breakthroughs in Deep Learning have boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. Through minimal use of theory and maximum practical examples, this text helps you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With regular examples throughout, it’s a great book to not only grasp how and why it all works, but to also test it yourself.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"10-must-read-machine-learning-books"},"tags":[{"_key":"R9BEAeeH","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"OUl8Z7DG","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"}],"title":"10 Must-Read Machine Learning Books"},{"_createdAt":"2020-11-18T19:05:07Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

Machine Learning is a subset of AI which includes abstruse statistical techniques, supporting gradual task improvement through experience gained. These broad sets of algorithms are used to extract useful models from raw data which are in turn used for a variety of mining tasks \u0026 synthetic tasks. In this blog we aim to explain both the various types of machine learning algorithms including supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, as well as highlighting its business use examples. Many of the terms used in the blog can be further understood through Google’s extensive ML glossary, found here.\n\n\n\n“Machine learning research is part of research on artificial intelligence, seeking to provide knowledge to computers through data, observations and interacting with the world. That acquired knowledge allows computers to correctly generalize to new settings”\n\n- Yoshua Bengio\n\n\n\nSupervised Learning - Definition, benefits \u0026 limitations\n\nRecognized as the most common type of Machine Learning, supervised learning algorithms are designed to learn through example, hence the term ‘supervised’. To achieve this, the algorithm uses provided input and output data. This provided data is labeled to provide a base for future data processing. Using this data, the goal is to produce an accurate mapping function which in-turn allows for prediction of the desired output. Supervised learning is then further compartmentalized into a range of algorithms, including, but not limited to decision trees, logistic regression \u0026 support vector machines. Of course, as with many facets of AI, supervised learning has both advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, supervised learning is a simple process to understand and is extremely useful in classification problems. That said, supervised learning is not ‘real-time’ data, meaning that there will be delays in results required. Alongside this, supervised learning requires substantial computation time for training and is considerably more complex in comparison to unsupervised learning due to the need for labeling all inputs.\n\nUnsupervised Learning - Definition, benefits \u0026 limitations\n\nUnsupervised learning refers to the process of giving an algorithm no labeled data and leaving it to structure its own output. Through this lack of labeling, models using unsupervised learning can suggest subtle trends that would otherwise be unfound, especially when using semi-supervised learning. Unsupervised Learning can be seen as extremely beneficial, as it then becomes possible to uncover previously unknown patterns in data. The downside? Unsupervised learning results make it hard to find meaning in the data due to the lack of answer labels and this also makes it harder to compare to supervised learning tasks. Applications of unsupervised learning include clustering, anomaly detection and association mining.\n\nBefore moving on to reinforcement learning, it is important to also address semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning sits between the two aforementioned methods, using a mixture of both tagged and untagged data to fit models. This technique is best suited for a large amount of data with both tagged and untagged sections. An example of this? Amazon’s Alexa! Jeff Bezos has previously spoken very highly of semi-supervised learning, suggesting that the reduced amount of labeled data needed to achieve the same accuracy improvement by 40 times.\n\n\n\nReinforcement Learning - Definition, benefits \u0026 limitations\n\nA recent buzzword, reinforcement learning is a technique used to aid the development of 'learning' in an environment, through the process of trial and error. This in turn, uses 'feedback' to correct itself. Unlike the above, whereby feedback provided to the agent is a correct set of actions for performing a task, Reinforcement Learning uses reward and punishment as signals for positive and negative behavior, with the goal to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent. This feedback design acts as a motivational factor for the RL-agent, whereby an understanding of outcome pushes the agent to learn the method of maximizing accumulated rewards over time. Applications of reinforcement learning are often seen in robotics for industrial automation, for data processing and in the creation of training systems. This technique has many positives, including being seen to solve various complicated problems which cannot be solved with conventional techniques including robotic movement and video game completion, similar to human problem solving in regard to process and repeat and the lessening in the potential for repeat mistakes.\n\nA challenge that should be recognized when looking at RL is the time it takes to generate data. This seems to be commonplace in the majority of keynote discussions surrounding different algorithms and subsets of AI. Alongside this, it is suggested that RL assumes the world is Markovian, which it is not. The Markovian model describes a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.\n\nMachine Learning, in its many forms, is seen as a staple in AI, with the potential to scale, a key factor in the growth of intelligent machines. A number of industries utilizing large swathes of data already recognize the potential of ML, as it’s regularly used in financial services, healthcare, government processes, transportation, and more. Using ML not only increases the potential effectiveness of the product, but can aid in a competitive advantage over those proceeding without.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"types-of-machine-learning"},"tags":[{"_key":"xTN3uVzu","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"}],"title":"What Are the Types of Machine Learning?"},{"_createdAt":"2019-12-20T02:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.
