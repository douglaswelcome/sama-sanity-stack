As we continue to look for ways to improve the lives of many each day, we’re excited to introduce Chloe, an automated public chatbot service to support in the fight against the coronavirus. We’ve partnered with several leaders in artificial intelligence development including Dialogue Technologies, MILA, Nu Echo, along with support from Google, John Hopkins University and Dataperformers, to enhance this service.\n\nSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, information has constantly been evolving. Most of us don’t have the time or mental capacity to check the news or medical reports on an hourly or daily basis. It’s not because we don’t want to be informed, but it's become nearly impossible to keep up, especially on top of everything we’re dealing with at home and at work.\n\nIt’s affecting the healthcare workers who are at the forefront of this fight and it’s also affecting individuals mental well being and causing anxiety to surge. That’s why we’ve decided to offer our services to help support an online system that will do it for you. Through Chloe, people can get the most up-to-date information instantly.\n\n“COVID-19 is impacting everyone at an alarming rate, that’s why we’re excited to work with such an astonishing group of professionals to help power such a vital service. Our team is honored to have been able to help make this happen.” - Wendy Gonzalez, CEO, Sama\n\nThe Chloe chatbot is available today and supports Canadians by becoming the first phase of getting care - both for your physical and mental wellbeing. Providing current and verified information about COVID-19 with clear answers to specific questions on the subject is the first step. At the end of the assessment, it will provide you resources that correlate with your medical inquiry. But we know that having a clear sense of mind doesn’t stop there. If the assessment indicates that you have a likelihood of having been exposed to the virus, Chloe will answer questions about the testing phase and monitor people in self-isolation to keep track of their condition.\n\nChloe is powered through natural language processing technology (NLP). Our team at Sama makes Chloe smarter by helping her understand the human language. We have real people behind the chatbot, annotating every data asset to help ensure that citizens are getting the most accurate information available in real-time.\n\nWe believe that it’s our obligation to use our industry-leading annotation solutions to help as many people as possible navigate these trying times. Our goal is to provide a safe service with truthful, current and accurate information for everyone. We hope that you’ll sign up and take advantage of this free service. Let’s work together to help alleviate our first responders and support our healthcare system.\n\nWe’re excited to help bring Chloe to market and are eager to contribute what we can in this fight against COVID-19.\n\nTo access Chloe, please visit covid19.dialogue.co.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"chatbot-during-covid-19"},"tags":[{"_key":"k5wnuMl8","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"KjXPtdNx","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"A3zPSdd2","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"z3km6Gbw","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"oNwQIM12","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"Introducing Chloe: A ChatBot to Help You Get Accurate Health Information During COVID-19"},{"_createdAt":"2019-11-19T19:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

Here are 4 reasons e-commerce needs AI to stay ahead.","openGraphImage":null,"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"},"estimatedReadingTime":5,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-9cbf25ce2c598676fd52d23ab3fee8700b305c4a-500x333-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"plaintextBody":"Serving a niche audience, personalization, cultivating strategic partnerships, or even cutting costs in your supply chain to pass on the savings are well-known ways e-commerce enterprises remain competitive.\n\nHowever, in an era where an agile operation is fast becoming the expectation, here are four reasons e-commerce needs artificial intelligence to stay ahead.\n\nImprove Accuracy and Efficiency in Your Supply Chain\n\nDemand planning already uses machine learning to incorporate data and insights like store traffic, weather forecasts and competitor pricing in supply chain operations, but AI can also help improve accuracy and efficiency in your supply chain in other ways. \n\nSince working together, Sama has improved Walmart’s item coverage from 91 percent to 98 percent.\n\nTraining Walmart’s systems meant manually cataloging and evaluating more than 2.5 million items, and while sharpening the supply chain with AI comes with its share of challenges, having a training data partner with a commitment to quality and security helped further Walmart’s machine learning initiatives. \n\n\n\nStreamline Business Operations\n\nAI can play an integral role in streamlining e-commerce operations. For example, Amazon uses artificial intelligence to make adjustments in delivery routes and arrival times.\n\nOther retailers like Gap are also using a combination of human effort and automation (https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18526092/amazon-warehouse-robotics-automation-ai-10-years-away) to perform dynamic product picking in shipping warehouses. \n\nResearch continues on how to fully automate shipping warehouses, but it’s this level of human-in-the-loop AI (https://www.sama.com/samahub-platform)that shows great promise for e-commerce enterprises.\n\nWorking together, humans and machines can find ways to deliver customer orders with efficiency, providing a stark competitive advantage to companies who adopt AI as part of their operational roadmap.\n\nPut Product Recommendations on Autopilot\n\nA product recommendation engine allows you to suggest products uniquely suited for your buyers. Think of this algorithm as the digital substitute for brick and mortar store clerks who guide shoppers to relevant and similar products.\n\nOur work with Walmart contributes to the accuracy of their product recommendations, and we’ve also helped Getty’s Images catalog stock photos based on key attributes, to support the foundation of its recommendation engine.\n\nRecommendation engines help you up-sell, cross-sell and otherwise inspire customers to bundle offers and create custom solutions best suited for their needs, and according to a McKinsey report, Amazon’s AI-powered recommendation engine was responsible for 35 percent (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) of the company's revenue. \n\nIn addition to product recommendations, artificial intelligence can automate post-purchase activities like accurately timed repurchasing messages, so your buyers are their most ready to buy.\n\nCreate Immersive Customer Experiences\n\nToday’s always-connected consumer shops from multiple devices, putting seamless customer experiences at the core of driving customer engagement.\n\nA recent study showed that about two-thirds of shoppers (https://www.emarketer.com/content/two-thirds-of-internet-users-check-phones-in-store-for-product-information-skipping-store-associates) check their phone in-store for product information e.g. looking up product reviews, comparing prices, etc. Whether it’s to send targeted and relevant messaging and ads, or to enable real-world product scanning, e-commerce needs AI, in order to create immersive customer experiences at scale. \n\nWhen we work with companies that want to use AI in e-commerce, we notice a few common barriers in AI adoption, such as a lack of training data strategy, lack of talent and/or platform to get started with AI and a lack of high-quality data to properly train AI algorithms.\n\nIf any of these barriers are stopping you from implementing AI across your organization, we can help. Helping e-commerce enterprises keep up with the demand for personalization, while driving the best level of digital classification, i.e., enabling the maximum/optimal experience for users to describe and see what they are shopping for, is what we do.\n\nContact us (https://www.samasource.com/contact-us) to learn more about accelerating your ML pipeline with high-quality training data from Sama.\n\n\n","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-compelling-reasons-to-use-ai-in-e-commerce"},"tags":[{"_key":"DCGPNa4P","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"KwAtlFPO","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"1uBvx190","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"Cryu3t8R","label":"E-Commerce","value":"E-Commerce"}],"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"},{"_createdAt":"2017-05-24T21:33:56Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.
