But according to Laurence Moroney, Lead AI Advocate at Google, that’s not the only way to develop artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nSo these students got together and they realized... if they take a picture of the sky, they have data. If they measure the air quality on the sensor, they have a label.\n\nLaurence joined our podcast, How AI Happens, to share examples of exciting advances in AI that are happening all over the world, many with no more than basic mobile devices. Laurence and his team have made it their mission to evangelize the opportunity of AI and work towards democratizing access to the technology’s development, a mission they accomplish via MooCs, YouTube, and a series of books on AI development. \n\nIn this episode, Laurence shares the nature of AI hype cycles, how AI practitioners can navigate them within their own organizations, and some of the amazing opportunities coming into play when access to AI \u0026 ML is made global.

You'll hear from AI researchers, data scientists and machine learning engineers, as they get technical about the most exciting developments in their field and the challenges they're facing along the way. I'm your host, Rob Stevenson, and we are about to learn how AI happens.\n\n0:00:42.0 RS: You don't have to be an AI expert to be skeptical about all the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and machine learning. Every company claims they have it, every sales deck mentions it, and worse, the media act as if the rise of the machines is happening sometime in late 2022. But amidst this hype cycle, those in the know understand the opportunity has never been greater. Enter Laurence Moroney. He's an industry veteran who has authored several books on AI development and even advises British Parliament on their AI approach. His mission in his role at Google is to evangelize the opportunity of AI and work towards democratizing access to the development of this technology.\n\n0:01:25.3 LM: I'm an AI lead at Google, so I lead the developer advocacy team, and our job is really to help inform and inspire the world around machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning and all that good stuff. So working with developers, working with communities, universities, all of those kind of folks to really help scale out the message and the opportunity that's there with AI.\n\n0:01:47.4 RS: Laurence joined the podcast to discuss the nature of AI hype cycles, how AI practitioners can navigate those cycles within their own organizations, and some of the amazing opportunities coming into play when access to AI and ML is made global.\n\n0:02:01.8 LM: As for my background, I was doing developer advocacy for a few years prior to Google, at places like Microsoft, a wonderful start-up in Israel, called Main Soft, and at Reuters, the news agency, kind of doing an internal advocacy role there, and then prior to that, the typical software engineer, all of those kind of things. Although my background at school was actually physics, my degree was in physics, but I came to the realization that nobody hires physicists, or very few people hire them, and I guess I wasn't good enough a physicist to be hired, so I ended up in this wonderful field instead.\n\n0:02:37.9 RS: It's interesting, you're the second individual I've spoken to, who got their start in physics and now have a career in AI. Is that a natural progression? What do you think is the link there?\n\n0:02:48.2 LM: I honestly... I don't think there is a natural progression, it's probably just a happy coincidence and maybe you're over-fitting in your audience. Sorry, AI joke there. For me, my path to AI actually came... It was really interesting that... 'cause when I first graduated college as a physicist, and it was in the UK, and it was in the middle of the worst recession that they had had since World War II. The current one, obviously, 'cause of COVID, is even worse. But back then, this was a pretty bad one, there was no kind of jobs or anything. And the government launched an initiative in 1992, the UK government, that they were gonna put together a cohort of 20 people to become AI specialists who could maybe be form the backbone of trying to help industry through AI and all of that kind of thing. And they needed people who were smart, but unemployed, and I at least fit one of those criteria, and I was unemployed, but we kinda did this battery of tests, it was like these kind of strange movies kind of thing, and I was accepted into the cohorts, which was really, really cool. And then I guess I got bitten by the AI bug then.\n\n0:03:53.7 LM: But in 1992, trying to do any kind of AI program was intensely difficult, it really didn't have any practical use. We were learning the languages like Prolog and LISP, and there was no industrial use for them, but there was some really fun academic stuff that you could do. But in the end, the program failed completely, but the potential was there, and I gotta give credit to the UK government, of figuring this out back in 1992. They were a little bit early, but it was really cool that they did it. It's funny that recently, in the last couple of years, I've been doing briefs to the UK governments, around AI, and I was like, \"Hey, do you know about that program?\" And of course, the MPs there, they're all long gone, the ones that did it. And the current ones were like, \"Did we really do that? That's awesome.\" I guess that's what got me bit by the bug and that led me down a career of programming and software engineering, to get me where I am today.\n\n0:04:45.9 RS: I'm interested to hear that you are spreading this message of the opportunity of AI, but then you also see all of these companies who are sort of saying they have AI or using AI in their messaging. Is there a gap of actual technology there? What is the difference between the reality of the technology and maybe the hype surrounding it?\n\n0:05:04.7 LM: Yeah, it's a great question. And by the fact that there's so many people doing this and waving around the AI magic pixie dust, hoping for customers or VC funding, that... If nothing else, that is a signal that this technology does have legs. The question is, does it get lost in the hype cycle or do we bust out of the hype cycle and start doing something really interesting? I always like to talk about, there's the... Gartner has this hype cycle curve, where you start with the peak of inflated expectations, and then you drop into something called the trough of disillusionment, and then once you're in the through of disillusionment, that's when you can really understand what the technology is and then you start climbing up through the plateau of productivity. And the kind of behavior that you're talking about just means that we're kind of on the wrong side at the moment, of this peak of inflated expectations. Part of what I'd like to describe my job as, is to do some quantum tunneling through that peak and end up in the trough of disillusionment. So I'm a professional disillusioner.\n\n0:06:02.9 LM: And then once you get into that and you understand what the technology actually is and what it does, then you can start being really useful with it. Obviously, you can look to the past to be able to predict the future. And in my career, there have been two massive tectonic shifts in computing. The first was really the widespread advent of the web and internet technology. The second was the smartphone. And if you think about, exactly the same thing happened in both those cases. I'll talk about the smartphone, which is the more recent one. So the hype cycle at the time was like, \"Throw away your desktop PC, throw away your laptop. You'll be able to do everything on your phone.\" And it's like, \"Forget about Office Suites, forget about programming environments, all of these kind of things. You're gonna get your phone, you're gonna plug it into a station on your desk and a big monitor will magically appear and it'll change how work is done.\" Well, that didn't happen. That to me, was a great example of the hype around the smartphone. But the smart phone still was a massive revolutionary technology that created a tectonic shift in the industry. I saw a stat, the largest creator of jobs in Western Europe during COVID, was the smartphone ecosystem. So not just people building smartphone applications, but people using them, and all of the stuff around that, like delivery services and all that type of stuff.\n\n0:07:23.8 LM: So we could see, that revolution started in 2007, and even now, 14 years later, the economy is benefiting greatly from it. The web revolution, the same thing, there was a whole ton of hype around the web, every shop in existence will go out of business, libraries will close. There was disruption and there were changes as a result of the web, but of course there was, I believe, an overall net gain. So when you start seeing these kind of things like when the hype first came in, but the people who were able to see through the hype and to be able to do something reasonable and productive when they fell into the trough of disillusionment, created whole new industries. Google came out as a result of the web, Amazon, Facebook, the Apple are the highest market cap company in the world right now, and that came as a result of the smartphone revolution. So there's so much that can happen when you can understand the actual limitations, start building to them and then rise up through that plateau of productivity as it's called in the Gartner Hype Cycle.\n\n0:08:28.1 LM: And that's really what I'm here to do, that's my role at Google, is to help people who are technically savvy to understand, \"Here's the possibility of things that you can do. Here's what you need to communicate within your business,\" and so when your product managers or when your CEO is wanting to wave that AI magic pixie dust, that kind of stuff, then it's the case, well, you can be the person who's got the expertise, who's able to say, \"I know this domain, and here's where AI can be used in this domain for real.\" And it might be nice to attract attention through marketing or through VC, but when you build a real product and you start building a real market around that, that's when the business can take off.\n\n0:09:09.7 RS: So if I'm an AI practitioner and I am contending with the hype around AI, or the example you gave of the CEO who's white boarding, \"Can we do this with AI?\" How can I level set expectations? There seems to be this little bit of education necessary, to make sure that people are steeped in reality when it comes to, \"What can this technology do? And what can you reasonably expect within your organization?\"\n\n0:09:34.5 LM: Yeah, I think effective communication is the number one tool, managing upwards like that is the number one tool. I've had a number of those conversations with folks who just thought that they can wave their arms and say, \"AI,\" and then find a programmer who could build the AI for them as they envisage it. But then to kinda just talk them through, \"Well, this is how it actually works, this is what it actually is. And if you wanna reach these goals, here's the kind of work that you would need to do, to be able to reach them.\" And often, it's setting lower goals and having a plan to be able to reach those lower goals and then use that as a plateau to go further and further and further. And I find in general, like CEO speak or CXO speak, they like that, instead of a yes person going, \"Yes, we can do whatever your vision is,\" that kind of thing, to actually be able to say, \"Well, here's a plan for how we can get to a very profitable future. It may not be the vision that you have, but it's concrete,\" and often, the folks in that level see themselves as the inspirational folks who get the plan moving in that direction by setting the goal and setting the long-term vision.\n\n0:10:45.8 LM: And when somebody can communicate up like that to say it's like, \"Well, we can't reach the exact nirvana that you're specifying, but we can build great products to do A, B, C and D, not all the way A through Z, and we can do it in this time frame,\" that, having that level of expertise to be able to speak to that comfortably and realistically, ends up being, I think, a great gift for everybody. If we go back to the conversation of what AI is and what AI isn't, is that I always like to draw this diagram that I say, \"Okay, here's traditional programming,\" and traditional programming, I draw it as a box, and that box is saying, \"You're putting rules in, you're putting data in and you're getting answers out.\" This is what programmers and the software department in your company have been doing since the dawn of software time, and the case is, what a programmer does is, they have to figure out how to express those rules in the programming language, so computers can do the work.\n\n0:11:36.2 LM: So for example, a very simple thing, like in financial services, there's a ratio called the price over earnings ratio, that's often a good one to determine the value of a company or one of the signals to determine the value of a company. And that's a very simple rule. Get the data of the price, get the data of the earnings, divide one by the other, and then you get an answer. There's obviously far more complex ones than that, but I like to use that one as a simple example. And you hire programmers because they know how to express those rules in a programming language and run them in an infrastructure. In the machine learning and AI world, I flip the axis around on that box. So instead of you trying to figure out the rules, you give the machine the answers and the data, and you have it figure out the rules. So for something like price over earnings, it's overkill, you don't need to do it. But what if there are patterns in your data that you don't see?\n\n0:12:26.5 LM: There are things about this company, and you can get a wealth of data around a company that you're doing an analysis on, and you can see that this company has done extremely well in the stock market, but you have no idea why, and this company has done extremely well, and you have no idea why, and then these bunch have done badly and you've no idea why. So then you have the answers, they've done well, they've done badly. You have the data, and the idea behind machine learning and AI is then, you can build a system that can do that pattern matching of the answers to the data and figure out what the rules are, to be able to do that.\n\n0:13:01.1 LM: So for you to do that effectively, you need good data scientists. It's not just, you get a shovel and you throw the data into the machine and something magic happens. You have your data scientists to try and make this as efficient as possible by picking the columns in the database or maybe doing feature crosses on those columns, where multiply this one by this one, that kind of thing. And the same way as your coders today, they're not just typing on a keyboard and stuff magically appears, they are figuring out the rules, they're figuring how to scale them. And that's really where the magic of good data science department applies, and so you've got skilled people who know the domain data, who know how to build models, so that the data is being used efficiently, so you can train a model in a couple of hours instead of a couple of decades, and that kind of thing. So it's like, that's where those folks, beyond trendy, really, really can show massive value for the company. And I'd say the same analogy, if you can get a programmer to build an effective program that runs your business in a day or a week, as opposed to an ineffective programmer who takes years to do the same task.\n\n0:14:07.6 LM: The same kind of thing can be applied with data scientists, that they can figure out which parts of the data to shovel, which parts not to shovel, they can figure out how to label those answers and all of those kind of things, so that the machine learning engineer can do their job effectively.\n\n0:14:21.7 LM: The way I generally like to define AI itself is, when you make a machine that responds the same way that an intelligent being would respond. So computer vision is a good example of that, is that if I show you a picture of a cat... If I show you a picture of my pet, you would say, \"That is a dog.\" Showing a computer a picture of my pets, prior to AI machine learning, deep learning, it would see a whole bunch of pixels and it has no parsing of the content, other than white pixels, blue pixels, those kind of things. When you start using machine learning and deep learning to then kind of train a computer to understand the difference between a cat and a dog, and then I show it this picture of my pets, and the computer will say, \"That's a dog.\" Now, the computer is responding in the same way as an intelligent being would respond, and that to me, is what artificial intelligence is all about. So you play it a sound, and instead of it saying, \"Here's a number of audio levels,\" it's actually able to determine your speech and to determine what you're saying, the same way as an intelligent being would. That to me, is artificial intelligence.\n\n0:15:31.6 LM: There are lots of ways that you can get there. Machine learning, deep learning are probably the most efficient way for things like computer vision, for audio processing, for tax processing and those types of things. So if we think about it and what it is... In terms of what it is and what it's not, it's not this magic thing that you can just say, \"We're gonna... Like in a Dilbert cartoon, we're gonna say, \"Let's put machine learning and artificial intelligence into our product and we get an upgrade.\" It doesn't really work like that.\n\n0:15:58.7 RS: The training is in the interest of an inference. When your technology can make an inference, an accurate inference, it has mimicked human cognition, right?\n\n0:16:06.5 LM: Yeah, exactly. And the nice thing is then, it can even go beyond human cognition, and let me give an example of this, that blows my mind. And so we worked on a project for diabetic retinopathy, at Google, where diabetic retinopathy is the world's leading cause of blindness. And the thing about it is that, it's easy to diagnose and it's easy to cure with early diagnosis. India has the world's second largest population, but it has a shortage of over 100 thousand qualified ophthalmologists. So we worked with doctors and hospitals in India to gather lots and lots of retina scans, to see... We'd label these retina scans... Data plus answers. We'd label these, based on those five different buckets, no diabetic retinopathy, all the way up to severe, and trained a machine learning model on this, to be able to be an artificial intelligence to respond the way an ophthalmologist would, and it ended up, like the publications that we did in various journals, showed that it was at least equivalent to a qualified ophthalmologist and often better. And so, that's the first mind-blowing part.\n\n0:17:13.5 LM: But then the second mind-blowing part, and the one that really hooked my interest in this was then a scientist within Google was looking at the data and realized, we don't just have labels of the diagnosis, we also have labels of the person's birth gender, or the person's age, or the person's blood pressure.\n\n0:17:33.6 LM: Now, an ophthalmologist can look at the scan of an eye and see blood clots and determine do they have diabetic retinopathy or not, but an ophthalmologist can't look at that scan and pick their age, or pick their gender. And so what if you have all of this data, you have your answers, you have your data, what if we could feed this into a model and do it? And it ended up, they trained a model that was 98% accurate in picking the assigned gender at birth, which is as good as, if not better than the average human, but obviously much better than a human looking at a retina, that kind of thing. It would be 50-50, it would be a coin flip. But it was 90% accurate, and it was also able to predict their age, with a mean average error of about three years.\n\n0:18:19.1 LM: And a few times in the past, I've told this story to an audience and I'd asked the audience to guess my age, and on average, the audience was... The mean average error from the audience was way more than that, and they're looking at me, they're looking at my gray hair, they're looking at my mannerisms, they're not looking at my retina, and they're still getting it even more wrong than this was... Again, looking at the retina. So we talk about human cognition and that kind of stuff, but in some ways, doing this kind of pattern recognition, we can go beyond human cognition, with examples like that one. If you have the data and if you have the labels that it's possible now for a machine to be able to do the matching of that data to that label and spot patterns that you as a human, wouldn't previously spot, and then there's massive, untold opportunities in that. So again, if we get down into that trust of disillusionment, and part of that is, I'm saying Machine Learning is fancy pattern matching.\n\n[chuckle]\n\n0:19:13.8 LM: And that kind of thing. There's nothing magical about it. And then when you understand that and you say, \"Well, I have this wealth of data in my business, can I find new business opportunities with this?\" And the answer to that, then is potentially, yes. In the same way as that scientist at Google was able to build a system to be able to predict somebody's age from a retina scan, which nobody knows how you can look at a retina and determine an age. From the model that they built, so you can now do an audit of that, and there's something called attention mechanisms, so you can see where the computer is paying attention to, to be able to derive what it is in a retina that let's you pick somebody's age. But it's like those are the kind of things that now, that the brute-force aspect of sheer compute power, doing that kind of pattern matching allows you to come up with these new scenarios that will rise you up through that plateau of productivity.\n\n\n\n0:20:07.3 RS: Yes, so you said it was an attention mechanism? And this allows you to clue in on, this is the variables that it was taking into account to result in this insight?\n\n\n\n0:20:18.1 LM: Yeah. Exactly, exactly. I teach it in one of my Coursera courses. I do advanced computer vision. And there's one really fun example that we go through in that one, it's not the retina one, that one is a little bit too complex, but there's a very famous machine learning exercise, which is pictures of cats and dogs that I was talking about earlier on, and how you train a computer to be able to recognize the difference between a cat and a dog. And you build a machine learning model in the course that can quite accurately tell the difference between a cat and a dog. But then you also do the attention mechanism stuff on that. And it turns out the primary difference that in this case, the computer was looking at, to pick the difference between a cat and a dog was the eyes. Sometimes you think, \"Oh the cat has pointy ears, the dog has floppy ears, for the most part\" or \"Their noses look differently\", but for the most part, when this model was actually working to pick the difference, it was like those were the features that it had zeroed in on and so then I was able to learn from that and go, \"Aha, so now when I build a model, maybe I should focus on the eyes to be more efficient\", that type of thing.\n\n0:21:16.7 RS: Yes, it strikes me as a crucial mechanism in removing harmful biases, for example, from a black box AI, from being able to look under the hood and say, \"Okay, this is what it was looking at to get this insight\". That can help remove a lot of this fear and a lot of these potentially, harmful biases or incorrect assumptions that technology would make.\n\n0:21:41.9 LM: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And there's a technique, it's also called... There's a thing that you can build, called a class activation map, and the idea with the class activation map is, you're seeing what the computer was paying attention to. A funny story about them, the US Army, realized that maybe computer vision could be used to see things and images that humans couldn't see. And say take for example, on the battlefield, what about being able to see a camouflaged tank? That like a human could look at it, camouflage is designed to fool the human eye, but what if you could have a machine be able to detect like a camouflage camouflaged tank? So they did an experiment where they got a bunch of data scientists and a bunch of machine learning engineers and they gave them a tank, and they said, \"Hey, you go out into the woods and one day take a whole bunch of pictures of this tank un-camouflaged\", and then the following day, they got the camouflage nets, and they put the camouflage nets on the tank and take a whole bunch of pictures of this tank camouflaged. And so build a model off of this one to see if you can pick a camouflage tank or a non-camouflage one, and they did what all good data scientists do, they had a training set of data, they had a test set of data, they had a validation set.\n\n0:22:54.3 LM: They built their model, they ran it and it was like 99% plus accurate. And they were like, \"Oh my gosh, we have built something that can really, really change the course of the battlefield\". They presented that to the Army, the Army loved it, and then they took it out and tested it and it failed completely.\n\n0:23:10.8 RS: Oh no. [chuckle]\n\n0:23:12.5 LM: And the reason why it failed completely was that, they took the pictures of the un-camouflaged tank one day, and they took the pictures of the camouflaged tank on another day. And on the day that they took the camouflaged tank, the sky was cloudy, and on the other day they had a blue sky, and then when they fed this back through an intention mechanism, they realized they didn't build a camouflage detector. They built a cloudy sky detector. [chuckle] So with the black box element of this kind of thing, it's easy to think that these are hard to debug and that kind of stuff, but they're not necessarily that difficult to debug if you understand how they're architected, and if I gave the elevator pitch for how you to do this, when you train an AI system or a machine learning system, you're flowing data one way and doing back prop the other way, but when you wanna do these attention mechanisms, those kind of things, it's just the way of flowing data in the other direction and effectively de-compiling it. If you're going through convolutions, you're de-convoluting it and that kind of stuff, and you can get a pretty good estimate for how the computer is looking at your data.\n\n\n\n0:24:12.1 RS: What is the difference between a classification map and an attention mechanism?\n\n\n\n0:24:15.6 LM: A class activation map is a...\n\n\n\n0:24:17.1 RS: Yeah. Thank you.\n\n\n\n0:24:18.3 LM: So it's a case of when you build a Convolutional Neural Network in particular, you're learning filters that can isolate features in a map, and a class activation map is where you just figure out where those features are on, you light it up on a diagram with a heat map or something like that. And that is a type of attention mechanism. There are also other ways of you being able to pick out attention within a machine learning model or something like that. Class activation maps are a very common one that are used in Computer Vision. Anything that you do, Convolutional Neural Networks, to be able to identify features, there are... Sometimes also use used Convolutions for sequence maps, so if you wanna predict weather in the future or something like that, you may use a one-dimensional convolution on that, and you can potentially have a class activation map there where it spots like, \"Hey, when you got a spike followed by a dip\", in this kind of thing, then that's usually followed by something else. But typically, it would be in an image-based one, it's where it's most commonly used.\n\n0:25:17.6 RS: I like how you mentioned the examples of the smartphone and understanding Hype Cycles, I'm curious if there are any lessons you think we can learn from the way that, that sort of technology was deployed and iterated upon that we can correct or do better with... As AI is sort of spread to the world.\n\n0:25:35.7 LM: The first part is letting people realize that they are in a hype cycle, we've been in hype cycles before. The people who were successful, were the ones... Or initially successful, at least, were the ones who saw through that, and this is what they did to see through it. Exposure to the platform, exposure to the technology, trying out new and exciting and different things, there's a whole graveyard of failed apps on Android and iOS, which laid the framework and the pathway for those apps that were successful. So really being those kind of early adopters, having that, try what you can, learn, iterate, continue. That's what's led to success, and I think that's the same kind of thing that can lead to success in the AI space.\n\n0:26:19.2 LM: One of the advantages of the AI space, is that the amount of investment that you have to make to be successful is a lot less than the amount of investment you might have previously had to make to become the big mobile app developer or to become the big website, and as a result, you don't necessarily have to be housed in the traditional areas on centers of excellence and success. So if we can try to democratize AI as much as possible by making it as available to as many people as possible so that they can seize opportunities that the rest of us may not actually think about, that could pave the way to success for them and for everybody else also. For every success, there's probably going to be a 100 failures, and it's really understanding that, realizing that, but I would rather have a 101,000 people do something so that there's a thousand successes and 100,000 failures, than have 1001 people do it where there's only one success, if my math add up. I told you I'm not very good at math.\n\n[chuckle]\n\n0:27:23.4 RS: Yeah, the one... Yeah, I think that adds up. Of course, the YouTube channel and the MOOCS, and a lot of the content that you produce is any in the interest... It's accessible anywhere. Someone who has internet access can learn from an expert, such as yourself. I do worry though, at what point is there a breakdown in terms of the hardware and the ability to actually design this technology? Does one need access to cloud computing and a work horse of a laptop to be able to play in this field?\n\n0:27:53.3 LM: To be able to get started and play in this field, absolutely no. To be able to go huge in this field, you do need access to high-end hardware like GPUs and TPUs and that kind of thing. So to split those two audiences for the Getting Started one, that's where we've been very carefully focused on easy high-level APIs that will run in Python, which is easy to install and use, that you can do on any laptop with the a CPU so that you can get up and running and kick the tires with these kind of things and to make that as quick and easy as possible for anybody to do. When you go beyond that though, and you start trying to train bigger models, not everybody has access to GPUs, not everybody has access to TPUs. So part of our strategy there was, we have this thing called Google Colab, and Google Colab is an in the browser notebook that runs with a Google Cloud back-end that can provide you free access to a GPU or a TPU. Obviously it's limited, but it's pretty generous. It's many hours of training that you can get for that, and all you need is a browser and a web connection to be able to do that, if you don't already have the hardware.\n\n0:29:00.3 LM: So that's the one first part of the offering. The another part of the offering though, is that when we start thinking about where do your models execute? Okay, so that many models are gonna be built to execute in data centers, the likes of Google or Amazon or Microsoft or on... But that's not the only area of opportunity, we can see that the area of opportunity on mobile handheld devices, embedded systems and all those kind of things is possibly even larger. And with the price of them dropping sharply, the hardware to build a phone is getting cheaper, the hardware to build embedded systems is getting cheaper. Then as long as we have an ecosystem of tools that will allow you to build for them with as low a dollar cost of entry as possible, as low an intellectual cost of entry as possible, those kind of things, that's when those markets can be seeded and those markets can grow. And like I said, I think we can all benefit. Let me share one example, 'cause there's a great project that... It was a couple of years ago, that was built by a bunch of high school and college students in India. And it's called Air Cognizer, I think that's the right phrase.\n\n0:30:09.6 LM: And it's on the YouTube web... The TensorFlow YouTube website. And what they did was that they realized that in their city in India, there was extensive air pollution. And you know what it's like, we all probably are encountering and nowadays with fires nearby, I live in Washington, so every year we have to start looking at air quality because of forest fires. But what they realized was that, when you look at air quality and you see it on the news, or you see it on a website, that's the air quality at a sensor, which is being operated by somebody. Now that might be 20-30 miles from where you live, and the air quality where you live might be severely worse. Elderly parents that they had and grandparents were afraid to go out because they don't know the air quality and they could get sick. So these students got together and they realized if they get a sensor to measure the air quality, and they get a phone, a cheap Android phone with a camera on it, if they take a picture of the sky, they have data. If they measure the air quality on the sensor, they have a label, and if they go all over their city and they take lots of these pictures and lots of these sensors, you do that basic pattern matching to kind of build a model where you're saying, \"Well, when the sky looks like this, the pollution is like this\".\n\n0:31:27.8 LM: And they turned that into an app, and now lots of folks in India can use that app where they can just take a photo of the sky and see a good prediction of the air quality near them, instead of looking at the news and seeing an air quality indicator that could be 20, 30, 40 miles away. And it's like little things like that, little innovations like that, because these were high school and college students, they don't have a lot of money, they're not forming a startup where they're hiring developers to do this kind of thing, the equipment for them to do that, was basic laptops that they had, the data? They generated the data themselves because they had the sensor and they had a cell phone where they could take a picture of the sky, they were able to build a model for this using the open source ecosystem, and they were able to deploy it for free to Android phones.\n\n0:32:12.5 LM: These kind of things, when I talk about really lowering that bar so we could raise the floor, but now it's like, \"Well, the rest of the world can benefit from what they learned\", because we now have the same problem in the West because of forest fires. And I could potentially go out and do the same thing to build an Air Cognizer for Washington State without needing to invest millions of dollars in a start-up to do so. So when you bust through that hype cycle and you understand how this works, then you can think like that, and that's what they did, they thought like that, and boom, they came up with this really cool solution.\n\n0:32:42.8 RS: This is the focus of your, about to be published, new book. Is that correct?\n\n0:32:47.1 LM: Yep, so it's an AI and Machine Learning for On-Device Development is my upcoming book. I originally was gonna create this mega-book for O'Reilly called AI and Machine Learning for Coders. We realized this weighed too much for one book.\n\n[chuckle]\n\n0:33:02.4 LM: So last year, I released the AI and Machine Learning for Coders, and now this year, it's kind of like the complimentary book/sequel, which is a AI and Machine Learning for On-Device Development. So it's really showing you how, as a mobile developer, you can start using models on Android, on iOS and a little sprinkling of doing it in a server with remote access or doing it on things like Raspberry Pi. It's packed with lots of examples of things like, you take a picture, here's how you can detect a face in the picture. Or here's how you can count the number of objects in the picture, like maybe you're building an app that's counting traffic, driving past your house. How do you count the number of cars? Those kind of examples... So I try to get very hands-on with them, of like, here's basically how this stuff works on your device. As of today, you don't train models on the device, you use models on the device. So the concept of my first book, AI and Machine Learning for Coders, or my first book in the series was really, \"Here's how you build the models\", and then the second book is, \"Okay, when you have models or there are off the shelf models available, here's how you use them, or here's how you can customize them to actually use them on your device\".\n\n0:34:16.9 RS: Okay, so the model is not constructed locally? The model is accessed?\n\n0:34:20.9 LM: Yeah. As of today, trying to train a model on a mobile device, it's just going to be very hostile towards your battery because model training is very intensive. We are doing a lot of work on making that better, but as of today... Yeah, as a developer, you're better off training a model in the cloud with something like Colab, or on your developer workstation and then deploying it to your device.\n\n0:34:46.4 RS: Yes.\n\n0:34:47.3 LM: But that's changing. That is changing.\n\n0:34:48.1 RS: Yeah. Well, fans of this podcast will remember our episode with Sama CEO, Wendy Gonzalez, who was speaking about this similar kind of problem of, \"How do we democratize access to AI?\" and I can envision an approach to that, which is just drop a 100 copies of your book and a 100 Android devices, just anywhere in the world and let a rip, right?\n\n0:35:10.2 LM: Yeah, yeah, please do. I'd love to see the results.\n\n0:35:16.8 RS: Laurence has published all manner of content about the realities an opportunities of AI, both philosophical and technical.

Decisions around building a robust data pipeline are among the most fundamental.\n\n\n\nChoosing the right data partner will obviously impact how well a model performs. If we look a bit deeper, we also find that this choice has a real impact on the well-being of the whole data supply chain workforce. Sometimes collectively referred to as data enrichment professionals, all workers involved in the data supply chain—from labelers to quality analysts—are affected by an organization’s data procurement decisions. \n\nThe complexity of the data procurement process combined with a lack of standards around equitable data supply chains has several downstream implications for these essential but largely unseen workers. Despite their foundational role, working conditions for data enrichment professions can be precarious: they can face wage uncertainty, low pay and limited career growth opportunities.\n\nYour data enrichment choices have a direct impact on workers’ well-being\n\nThere is, however, an opportunity to make a difference. The decisions organizations make while procuring data labeling services can have a meaningful impact on the working conditions of data enrichment professionals.\n\nPartnership on AI (PAI) is a multistakeholder organization that brings together academics, researchers, civil society organizations, companies building and using AI technology, and other groups working to better understand AI's lasting impacts. Their latest white paper Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services examines the working conditions of data enrichment professionals, and seeks to:\n\nCritically evaluate the impact of the industry’s current practices on workers;\n\nExplore practices the industry can adopt to improve worker well-being; and\n\nAdvance the discourse around the future of data enrichment work and the indispensable role it plays in AI development.\n\nThe paper gives AI practitioners and decision makers visibility into the impact of their decisions in procuring data enrichment services – from selecting providers, to running pilots, to conducting quality assurance and more.\n\nRead the full white paper: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services\n\nSince data labeling is a key part of this equation, it was important for Sama to partner with PAI: to both share our lessons learned from several years of striving for more ethical supply chains, and to continue to learn from industry peers about responsible AI.\n\nIn fall of 2020, Sama participated in the five-week series of Responsible Sourcing workshops held by PAI, the output of which was a set of strategic recommendations for this white paper. The workshops brought together more than 30 professionals from different areas of the data enrichment ecosystem including representatives from data enrichment providers, researchers and product managers at AI companies, and leaders of civil society and labor organizations. \n\nTo fully understand the impact of AI on society, one must examine the bias and shortcomings of models, but also the means by which they are created.\n\nWhile more work and research is needed, Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services shares actionable insight that practitioners can use as a starting point to raise important conversations with internal stakeholders. Our hope is that these conversations will be a step in the right direction: toward giving data enrichment professionals better recognition for the critical role they play in building AI. \n\nRead the full white paper: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services\n\n\n","seo_title":"New White Paper by Partnership on AI: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"partnership-on-ai-whitepaper"},"tags":[{"_key":"pwpeoY5O","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"Sf3M02mD","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"}],"title":"New White Paper by Partnership on AI: Responsible Sourcing of Data Enrichment Services"},{"_createdAt":"2021-05-05T16:24:03Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1fd7fbcc4633299cdbedddba22cb44e24f17317-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

She was interviewing me and spoke excitedly about the potential of Sama achieving B Corp certification, one of her main priorities for the company. In the next breath, she talked about dominating the training data industry and catapulting Sama to claim its much-earned spot in the AI landscape.\n\nThis introduction was just the first of many conversations we would later have on the importance of sustainability, impact, and responsible hyper-growth.\n\nI’m deeply humbled and honored to announce that, as of today, Sama is among the first AI companies to receive the prestigious B Corp certification. The achievement comes on the heels of completing our three-year Randomized Control Trial (RCT), which demonstrated the actualized impact of our hybrid model and continued commitment to fusing purpose and profit, both internally and externally.\n\n\n\n“This achievement is the result of years of hard work and dedication from our entire Sama community. By securing B Corp certification and completing our RCT, we’re not only carrying Leila’s passion and commitment to impact, but we’re making a tremendous stride within the AI industry,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “I’d like to extend immense thanks to everyone who played a part in making Leila’s dream a reality.”\n\n\n\nB Corp certification is a measurement certified by B Lab, a non-profit company that measures a company’s social and environmental performance. We received a score of 98.5, excelling in the ‘Workers' and 'Community Impact' criteria, and placing us well above the 80 points necessary to achieve B Corporation status. Of the 3,500+ Certified B Corporations, Sama is the first and only AI company recognized and joins companies such as WeTransfer, Patagonia, Hootsuite, and Ben \u0026 Jerry’s, all who use business as a force for good.\n\nThree years ago, Leila kicked off what would become a rigorous journey towards completing a full RCT. This in-depth trial, often referred to as the \"gold standard\" in research, evaluated our training and employment effectiveness towards our mission of creating a sustainable pathway out of poverty. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive either training through Sama (Group 1), training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\nOne of the trial’s main findings is that individuals who are trained and employed by Sama make higher levels of employment and earnings (Group 2). This study and subsequent completion of the RCT further validated the training programs we’ve created at Sama, an impact model that has helped 50,000 people lift themselves out of poverty, increased wages by 4x, and provided over 11,000 hours of training. \n\nBecoming B Corp certified and completing an RCT in tandem is a direct example of how our team at Sama is leveraging AI to address critical societal issues. This year has proved that making a real impact and having a mission-driven business model is what truly matters in driving the bottom line. We believe that receiving B Corp certification should be the new metric companies strive for in today’s day and age. It’s not just about chasing after unicorn status anymore, it’s about creating a successful company while creating meaningful change. \n\nWe’ve accomplished our goals in large part as a result of our supportive community, but it doesn’t stop here. We’re looking forward to continuing our commitment to making a lasting impact on the world and improving the lives of as many as possible.\n\nDue to our hardworking team and our supportive investors, friends and family, we’ve been able to follow through on the vision and legacy created by our founder, Leila Janah.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Sama team, thanks for taking this journey with us.","seo_title":"From Dreams to Reality: Our Journey to Becoming a Certified B Corporation","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"we-are-a-b-corp"},"tags":[{"_key":"hZTYAcKb","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"DDJ2bEmS","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"oKWZS5Lg","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"AuzJCOHb","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"From Dreams to Reality: Our Journey to Becoming a Certified B Corporation"},{"_createdAt":"2020-08-26T18:18:07Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

This systemic challenge we face requires not only immediate action. It requires a change in the way we think, see, and operate.\n\nTrue change happens with purposeful action and in the decisions we make every day. It takes investment for the long term, even when there is pressure to perform in the short term. As I’ve been telling my teams as we organize to contribute the fight for justice for Black people, “We are in a marathon, not a sprint.”\n\nI also firmly believe that change starts locally. It starts with us as individuals and within our communities.\n\nLastly, change needs to be measurable - not just this quarter or next, but on an ongoing basis. We need to hold ourselves accountable to ensure we’re making positive progress toward a more just, equitable society. Since our founding in 2008, we have treated our impact metrics with the same level of fidelity and reporting as we have our financials. We will apply the same rigor of measure to the Black Lives Matter engagement strategy and actions I’m committing to today.\n\nFollowing our company values, we’ve decided to take action both inside our organization and in partnership with local organizations to drive toward a more equitable society where Black people in America realize the same level of humanity as others.\n\nI’m committing to four core initiatives to support racial inclusion.\n\nFinancial Support: Earlier this week, we launched a corporate matching program to raise donations for three local organizations. Sama seeded this program with funds and is matching each employee donation 2:1. The three local organizations include:\n\nCode2040, a San Francisco based nonprofit activating, connecting, and mobilizing the largest racial equity community in tech to dismantle the structural barriers that prevent Black and Latinx technologists from fully participating in the tech industry.\n\nAI4ALL, an Oakland based non-profit lead by a Sama alum, opens doors to artificial intelligence for underrepresented talent through education and mentorship.\n\nColor Of Change, an Oakland based organization, is the nation’s largest online justice organization. They design campaigns powerful enough to end practices that hold Black people back, and champion solutions that move us all forward.\n\nHoodstock, a Montreal based organization, generates spaces for dialogue and mobilizing initiatives to eliminate systemic inequalities and develop supportive, inclusive, secure and dynamic communities.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: While we have rigorous programs in place to address gender diversity and inclusion, and enjoy a cross-cultural mix of people within our organization, we found that our North American diversity representation could be improved. To achieve this goal, we’re committing to expand our gender diversity and inclusion program to specifically include inclusion metrics for Black and other people of color.\n\nInternal Education: We are committed to hosting internal education and engagement sessions covering topics such as institutional racism, racial bias in AI, diversity hiring best practices, and the importance of voting. We also started an internal forum for our teams to openly exchange ideas for action and provide additional support to each other.\n\nPartnerships: We are engaging with partners within the AI community committed to better understanding and taking action against AI Bias. We’re also engaging with organizations that support upskilling, mentoring, and recruitment to drive economic mobility and inclusion for Black Americans in the tech industry.\n\nMy hope is that everyone in our broader technology community will drive the change needed to make the United States a more equitable and inclusive country. We must stand together and bring humanity to our industry, and to our country.\n\n(In case you missed it, below is our original statement. )\n\nThe murder of George Floyd has reignited an international movement for equality and justice. It sparked a powder keg of emotions that have left many feeling frustrated, helpless, angry, outraged, and sad. We here at Sama stand by one of our core company values -- Humanity. Humanity for the countless number of Black lives who have been victims of police brutality. Humanity for every person that tries to survive daily in a system that routinely oppresses them. Humanity for those who so often do not receive it, all because of the color of their skin.\n\nThe world of tech so often speaks of creating a new, better world -- but we cannot do that if we do not stand for the rights of everyone. Humanity and compassion are necessary. In order to avoid bias in ourselves and the technology we produce, we must consider how daily actions, words, and thoughts contribute to a racist and prejudiced world.\n\nTo quote our late founder Leila Janah, “Don’t underestimate the ripple effect of what you do. These kinds of small actions undertaken in coordination by large numbers of people have toppled empires.” We stand in solidarity with those driving positive change.

In addition to spearheading our impact model, she sparked a deep love of nature in the visitors to our East African offices by increasing their exposure to African nature and wildlife. One of her favorite topics to muse about over the past few years was how to calculate the positive climate impacts of hiring and empowering women in East Africa.\n\nOn this 50th anniversary of Earth Day, I want to take the time to remember Leila’s legacy by giving you a glimpse into a few of the sustainability activities we are working on here at Sama. Mid last year, we officially launched our sustainability program. Our first goals were to understand our carbon footprint (GHGe per GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, Scope 1 and 2), develop an environmentally preferable purchasing program for ongoing consumables, and create biophilic office environments that brought nature inside.\n\nPHOTO: Sama East Africa delivery center\n\n\n\nUltimately, Leila wanted to pursue B Corporation certification. She always wanted to lead by example, to show the world how business could be both profitable and a force for good.\n\nWhat better way to do this than provide the ultimate success story and demonstrate that a technology company can be committed to both providing the leading training data platform and to using business as a force for good?\n\n“One of the things I’m proudest of at Sama is our collaboration with conservation groups including the Nature Conservancy to use AI to track endangered species, combat poaching, and protect wilderness. Not only that, but we do it by employing women (more than 50% of our workforce!) from low-income backgrounds, which itself is a way to fight climate change.” - Leila Janah\n\n\n\nI’m thrilled that Sama is actively engaged with B Lab and is in the final stages of audit verification for our B Corporation certification. I couldn’t be prouder of our Nairobi based Sustainability Analyst, Robert Wahome, for ensuring we have all of the data in place needed to drive this initiative forward, including our first ever Carbon Footprint. In my heart, I know Leila is proud too.","seo_title":"Celebrating 50 Years of Earth Day: Honoring Leila Janah's Legacy","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"celebrating-50-years-of-earth-day-honoring-leila-janahs-legacy"},"tags":[{"_key":"OFjdWc6T","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"OtSjlWNo","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"fWAUAQ8u","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Celebrating 50 Years of Earth Day: Honoring Leila Janah's Legacy"},{"_createdAt":"2020-03-08T19:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

I’m grateful that everyday I get to witness history in the making as part of a female-led tech company that provides industry leading, high quality training data technology and solutions that are underpinned by an ethical AI supply chain.\n\nIt’s this commitment to an ethical supply chain that enables us to close the gender pay gap by paying a living wage to all of our employees.\n\nThe AI supply chain is the combination of the human workforce and advanced technology solutions that help bring machine learning based systems to market. To operationalize AI, everything from data labeling to model development needs to be in sync, and as it is with any supply chain, ethics and sustainability come into play. \n\nBehind every Al, there’s a person deciding what data is needed and the best model to use. There’s also someone guiding AI strategy, developing the tech to support AI pipelines, and so on.\n\nData annotation is a key part of making machine learning possible, and conversations around ethical AI supply chains are vital to have now if we want to ensure the labeling industry is a positive force.\n\nAccording to our baseline impact survey data, prior to joining Sama, female workers in our global delivery centers earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, despite having comparable educational backgrounds.\n\nWe found that gender discrimination—especially in the technology sector—and the challenge of being a primary family caretaker make it difficult for many women to get into and stay in the formal employment sector in Kenya and Uganda.\n\nWomen are highly driven and eager to align their education with real-world opportunities, yet a recent report from the World Economic Forum found that if progress continues at its current rate, it would take roughly 95 years for sub-Saharan Africa to achieve gender parity.\n\nThis number is astonishing, but there is a path forward, and it involves equipping younger generations with the skills needed to succeed in the growing digital economy.\n\nAt Sama, our workers receive digital literacy training, as well as specialized training on artificial intelligence and our advanced training data platform. Also, in addition to connecting women and youth to dignified digital work, workers gain access to life and professional skills development opportunities, to further advance their careers.\n\nWhen women succeed, everyone benefits, and closing the gender gap at work is key to achieving at least five of the sustainable development goals set by the UN.

It’s his second year working at Sama, and before becoming an AI trainer, he was a student at the local university, moonlighting as a farmer.\n\nWorking in AI was not a path Ocem imagined until he was recruited to work at Sama. In fact, like many students, his greatest uncertainty was whether he could put his degree to good use at all, post graduation.\n\nOcem’s story is like many other young professionals in East Africa, but as AI adoption explodes, these talented, untapped communities are finding work they never thought possible, at the cutting edge of AI.\n\nHere are four ways AI makes a positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nGainful Employment\n\nA report by the World Bank shared that 60 percent of the unemployed in Africa are youth, who after graduating from University will take on average, one year to find employment in their field of study. \n\nI believe this is due to the lack of formal career opportunities within the region, making it difficult for the employment industry to support the volume of college graduates entering the workforce.\n\nAs a result, talented graduates find work in menial jobs that often don’t provide a sustainable income, but Sama and other tech companies are working to fix that.\n\nThe explosion of AI has birthed the demand for high-quality, ground truth data for artificial intelligence, and with training, recent graduates like Ocem can find meaningful work in the growing digital economy.\n\nDriven by a mission to expand opportunity for low-income people, Sama's social impact business model has helped over 50,000 people move themselves out of poverty through digital work.\n\nWorkers in our East Africa centers are paid a living wage and competitive benefits. They also receive ongoing digital skills training and have access to professional development opportunities that further help increase the purchasing power of their communities, potentially ending a long cycle of poverty.\n\nSkills and Knowledge\n\nAs more tech companies expand operations to Africa, and more people start gaining on-the-job experience working in machine learning and AI, the positive impact AI makes on communities in East Africa will only expand.\n\nI’ve personally witnessed how energized the youth in East Africa are about the intricacies of enriching data for AI. For many, this budding tech boom has motivated them to enroll in courses centered around data sciences and AI.\n\nAlso, the Deep Learning Indaba, an annual meeting for AI enthusiasts in Africa has brought together a growing number of youths for week long discussions, debates and research on machine learning and AI.\n\nWith a reliable IT infrastructure, paired with increased trust in the skill level of youth workers in the region, East Africa has the potential to become a major hub for AI training data.\n\nAt Sama, our AI training classes fill up weekly, and this level of investment in skills development for young professionals is what’s needed to continue developing the talent pool. \n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nUnesco reported that 30% of the tech-workforce in sub-Saharan Africa are women, and despite the challenges of gender discrimination in the technology sector, the percentage of female workers is steadily growing. \n\nWomen in Africa have often been set apart from the tech industry because culturally, they were considered primary caretakers, expected to focus on their family, not their career. Now, the vast opportunities in AI are helping to change that.\n\nWe actively recruit women and youth to work in our East Africa centers, providing in-depth technical training, so underserved communities can pursue a career in AI. From scholarship programs to nursing rooms, we’ve also made it a priority to establish an office culture conducive to the success of women workers.\n\nOur baseline survey data found that women earned 70 cents for every dollar earned by men, before joining Sama. By ensuring we achieve gender parity in pay, while simultaneously paying a living wage, our workers can support themselves and their families sustainably.\n\nData Privacy and Protection\n\nAs more populations in Africa adopt mobile technology and digital apps, their exposure to AI-enabled technologies that collect data to improve experiences will only increase. These interactions can be as simple as product recommendations from an online store, or interactions with an automated messenger bot.\n\nGiven the rapid advancement of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) , the Kenyan government recently passed a data protection law which complies with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nSimilar to GDPR, this legislation outlines restrictions on data handling and sharing, in an effort to regulate the processing of personal data and information in the country.\n\nThis commitment to increased digital security will no doubt have a positive impact on the citizens of Kenya, and in many ways, it sets the standard for data privacy and protection across the continent.\n\nMcKinsey Global Institute predicts that AI has the potential to deliver an additional economic output of $13 trillion by 2030. This economic growth, alongside the digital transformation of sub-Saharan Africa will have enormous positive impact on communities in East Africa.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about how Sama connects people to dignified digital work, you can read about our social business model here.","seo_title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-ways-ai-makes-a-positive-impact-on-communities-in-east-africa"},"tags":[{"_key":"AEPEpJXp","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"tc6Hsfbm","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"VmY4sBKG","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"iLYfly0n","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"4 Ways AI Makes a Positive Impact on Communities in East Africa"},{"_createdAt":"2019-08-27T16:55:52Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

But another key part is how partners think through the role that rigorous impact evaluations can play in achieving their learning goals.\n\nAn understated part of a successful RCT is the internal organizational buy-in that our implementation partners make to deliver their services in a way that complies with the design of a rigorous evaluation. I was able to catch up with Twisha Mehta from Sama, currently in the middle of an evaluation of their program in Kenya, to hear a partner’s perspective of the goals and challenges they met along the way.\n\nSama provides secure, high quality training data and validation for AI. They count the most prestigious technology firms as their clients and serve technology teams driving humanity forward. As an early adopter of Impact Sourcing, the core of the Sama business model is rooted in social impact. Their staff is driven by a mission to expand opportunity for low-income people through the digital economy.\n\nWhat is Sama, and what’s the program being evaluated?\n\nSama is a social business that provides training data strategy, annotation, and validation services to technology companies. We have global delivery centers in Uganda, Kenya, and India that provide language and computer vision data services for use in machine learning algorithms, such as those used in self-driving cars and virtual reality applications.\n\nOur business model is predicated on the idea that, when combined with the appropriate technology platform, we can effectively train a workforce comprised exclusively of workers from low income, low education backgrounds to deliver high quality digital services at market competitive quality and prices. This is the driving idea behind our Learning and Development (L\u0026D) training program. We recruit students to join 10 day bootcamps from low-income communities throughout Nairobi, Kamapla, and Gulu.\n\nUpon completing the training course, they are eligible to apply for jobs at our global delivery centers. For most trainees, this is the first formal job they’ve had. The curriculum covers basic digital skills, occupational skills relevant to AI work.\n\nThis RCT aims to understand the value of training as a stand-alone service along with the value of training in combination with the ability to apply for a job at our global delivery centers.\n\n(See IPA’s project summary for an easily digestible explanation of the impact evaluation)\n\nWhy was it the right time for a randomized evaluation? What do you hope to learn?\n\nAs a social business, we often face the dual challenge of generating social impact, while also balancing business needs of growth and scale. We’ve learned a lot along the way on how to do that effectively.\n\nMeasuring impact is important to us for a few reasons. First, we want to create more transparency about what we’ve learned. We want to change the mindset of private sector corporations that believe that you have to choose between social impact and profit. You can have both!\n\nWe’ve seen firsthand how transformative the power of a paycheck has been on the lives of the people who we hire. From that perspective we want to use this impact evaluation as a proof point.\n\nSecond, we’ve reached a stage of organizational maturity where we have unprecedented insights into our entire supply chain. Data is a core part of our DNA as we grow and scale- and we are committed to using it for continual learning. Operationally, this positions us to not only ask questions about our impact, but to make changes to our targeting and delivery model based on what we learn.\n\nCan you describe the process of running an RCT within a profitable business?\n\nInternally, we had support from the senior management team which recognized the business case for the RCT – we needed to undertake this study in order to prove the efficacy of our business model and prove that social businesses can thrive in the world (and back it up with rigorous impact data!).\n\nOperationally, the challenge was to deliver within the constraints of our demand driven business without compromising service quality. This meant getting buy-in from teams at the local level and working very closely with the local teams.\n\nWhat were the challenges?\n\nOur foremost concern was about our reputation and maintaining the trust we’ve built in the communities we operate in. It was very important to us to be forthright and transparent about the study process with the people we invited for our Learning and Development training boot camps.\n\nStill, it was a challenging shift for our trainers, who work closely with the communities we recruit from, to inform people that they were placed in the control group- and will not receive any training or opportunity to apply for jobs with Sama.\n\nTo mitigate any perceptions of unfairness, the team decided to run the randomization process with a physical lottery during the open enrollment periods. This helped interested students that were placed in the control group understand that it was simply the luck of the draw.\n\nThe second major challenge was to operationalize the research design. After all, our services are dependent on client demand and we can’t hire for new positions without securing work first. We worked closely with our various business units to forecast hiring based on client demand, then worked with the researchers to plan the research within those constraints.\n\nWhat’s next for this evaluation?\n\nAt Sama, we have a strong data driven culture across all of our business units. Data provides us with concrete evidence to pilot initiatives, understand their efficacy, and invest in ideas that work.\n\nThe RCT is a significant investment for our company. Good, bad, or ugly, we're going to share these results and learn from them. We know that we can use the results of this RCT to improve our training program to deepen our positive impact by creating more digital jobs.\n\nWhen we started, Sama was a seemingly far-fetched idea: Training and hiring marginalized East African youth to do digital work for some of the largest technology companies.\n\nHowever, several philanthropic funders including Rockefeller Foundation and Mastercard Foundation took a chance on us and helped us test and scale our idea until we reached financial sustainability. Seven years after we started, we hit financial sustainability- an elusive north star for many start ups!\n\nNow, as we complete our tenth year as a company, we look forward to the RCT results to validate our impact, create new academic literature on our model, and most importantly, provide evidence to our early supporters that well thought-out out-of-the box ideas are worth investing in!

Now we’ll spotlight one of our clients to show how our image annotation work can be used in machine learning to train image recognition algorithms.\n\nMarkable came to Sama for help training their state-of-the-art image recognition technology that identifies fashion products in photos and videos. With Markable’s tech in place, viewers can click on clothing they see while watching TV shows and Markable will generate matching product results. Check out Markable’s demo to see how it works.\n\nTo create image recognition technology, engineers develop a machine learning program that learns to identify objects of interest from training data. For Markable, the training data is photographs of fashion products, clearly labeled so when the algorithm encounters an unknown product, it can infer what it is based on trained examples. This process is called “supervised learning” because the algorithm is given examples structured specifically for training. A high-quality training data set for a vision algorithm consists of tens of thousands of images in which objects are outlined and labeled according to the desired classification. The accuracy of the training data is important as an algorithm trained with inconsistently labeled data won’t learn patterns and won’t be able to identify objects.\n\nHow do all those training data images get labeled accurately and quickly enough to get Markable’s tech to customers? That’s where Sama comes in. As part of our image annotation service, we have a trained, scalable workforce and the right tools to label thousands of images for training data, efficiently and accurately. We balance stringent quality requirements with on-time deliveries to ensure clients like Markable can stick to their project timelines.\n\nSama worked closely with Markable to understand the project’s annotation requirements and refine them for ambiguous images. Markable provided Sama with source images and then we trained a dedicated team of workers how to draw boxes around the objects of interest and label them. For Markable, Sama workers learned to identify every minor visible detail, such as heel-length of a shoe, to ensure exceptional data quality. Sama’s on-site quality analysts inspect a sample of annotated images daily to ensure quality, asking workers to redo any images that don’t meet client standards.\n\nHere’s what image annotation work looks like in the Hub. Agents draw bounding boxes (or tight outlines) around each object and then use a menu to add labels. In the for-presentation-only image below, a worker has labeled the shirt, pants and is labeling boots with a multi-level menu. Sama can set up label data entry to meet a variety of project needs: text entry, selection from a dropdown, or search for a label from a list, to name a few.\n\nWith Sama’s workers, Markable has been able to improve their algorithm and better serve their customers. They wrote to us: “With the help of Sama's annotation, we were able to surpass previous state-of-the-art accuracy on the largest open-source fashion e-commerce dataset. We had a great experience in working with Sama and we will continue working with them in future.”\n\nSama’s client relationships are a win-win: clients provide our workers with life-changing job opportunities and workers help clients achieve their business goals, even on the trickiest projects.\n\nIn our third and final post, we’ll show you how Sama’s workers take on a web research project.","seo_title":"Better Algorithms, Better Lives: Reducing Poverty Through Training Data","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"better-algorithms-better-lives-reducing-poverty-through-training-data"},"tags":[{"_key":"Bx4Do9xK","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"Rx6gXgmn","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"iujrQUVj","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"v5mZqxPX","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"Better Algorithms, Better Lives: Reducing Poverty Through Training Data"},{"_createdAt":"2017-05-15T23:51:58Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

And, if you’re like the majority of people reading this, the details of how exactly we do that are probably a little fuzzy. This post will dispel the mystery!\n\nSama developed an in-house SaaS (software as a service) platform that enables us to send work from our clients to workers at our delivery centers in Kenya, Uganda and India. Sama is the linchpin in our model, as it allows our project managers, agents, and clients to access the work being done, while also allowing us to closely monitor quality and provide feedback for continuous improvements.\n\nAs a SaaS platform, the Hub can be accessed securely from anywhere - our San Francisco headquarters to our Sama Center in Nairobi, Kenya. To support the Hub, we have a full time, dedicated engineering team that help the Hub evolve to meet changing client needs and continuously improve worker efficiency.\n\nDuring our sales cycle, Sama meets with clients to better understand their data services needs. When a contract is in place, a project manager will partner with the client to design a Hub project workflow that satisfies project requirements, a quality strategy to check work, a training plan and a delivery schedule.\n\nOn Hub, project managers then upload data from clients that our workers will clean, use as the basis for research, annotate or supplement. Next, they custom-design the task layout and workflow that workers will see when they log in to complete tasks. From question types and dependency logic to an easy-to-read layout, the Hub can accommodate a range of project needs.\n\nOnce the project is set up, workers complete specialized training to learn the new workflow. Throughout training, workers are coached by on-site team leaders and evaluated by quality analysts until their work is at or above the client’s desired SLA for quality. The SLA is the service level agreement, that is, the level of quality agreed upon in the client’s contract with Sama. When training is complete, workers begin production tasks on the Hub. During production, coaching continues to maintain quality. QAs use the Hub to check task quality and send back tasks that are below quality standards for rework. Once work is completed, it can be downloaded from the Hub or delivered directly to the client via API.\n\nIn future posts, we’ll go in-depth in two case studies to see how Sama completes work for different verticals: web research and image annotation for machine learning and computer vision applications, and how the Hub is an integral part of our process.\n\nStay tuned!","seo_title":"How Samasource Moves People Out of Poverty with Digital Work","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"how-exactly-does-samasource-move-people-out-of-poverty"},"tags":[{"_key":"Z2i2Xm9p","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"NE08Dk4r","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"mwOWz5qA","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"}],"title":"How Samasource Moves People Out of Poverty with Digital Work"},{"_createdAt":"2016-01-26T21:48:00Z","author":{"_id":"037257b7-27fe-47e4-8b0b-7fc05f55fa6d","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-d3fb21c2ca35139da39b453c1981b5d04545ab51-800x800-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":null,"name":"Leila Janah","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"leila-janah"}},"estimatedReadingTime":6,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-37701649c15c883643f12a6b0a10ebb11dfdd4c3-5472x3648-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"meta_description":"Davos: It's Not Enough to do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"I spent last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos raising funds for Sama and building Laxmi’s global community of retailers and partners. Along the way I came across some especially powerful ideas, and reinforced one of our own (the impact bond).\n\nHere are five key tech and social impact trends from this year’s Forum:\n\n1. It’s not enough to do less bad. We say this a lot in the office — new businesses can’t define themselves by avoiding the bad (not polluting, not hiring slaves, not using toxic ingredients). The best emerging companies, and the savviest traditional/old brands, understand that creating positive social and environmental impact in the world is important to Millennial consumers. Corporate social responsibility is dead — it feels too weak. We want to see corporate activism on issues like climate change, human rights, and equal pay. It’s already happening. Richard Branson’s B Team hosted a lunch on this and entertained several ideas put forth by social entrepreneurs (including my friends Jeremy Heimans and Nancy Lublin). Chanel’s chief legal counsel said during a brilliant sustainable fashion session organized by Zara Ingilizian that in an era of rising inequality, “the only way luxury can exist is through total integrity.”\n\n\n\n2. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the way leaders will talk about tech. Professor Klaus Schwab, WEF’s Founder, wrote a new book and named the conference after this theme. The Fourth Industrial revolution refers to digital integration across every industry, from agriculture (think smart crop monitoring via drones) to mindfulness (Paul Davidson’s Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction program is now online) and non-profit work (Nancy Lublin’s Crisis Text Line is a great example). Schwab’s idea is that technology is a revolution as profound as the Enlightenment — what came before will not predict what comes afterwards. There are pros and cons to this shift — we will see rising global prosperity and access to basic goods and services, but we’ll also see economic shocks as more jobs are automated.\n\n\n\n3. Impact bonds and pay-for-outcomes models will dominate global social sector funding. It’s crazy that we spend billions on global development programs that may or may not lead to outcomes — instead, agencies fund programs and activities. We need a new way to fund the most important social sector work that gives organizations the freedom to innovate and spend as they see fit, so long as they deliver. The social impact bond has been tried in dozens of settings — to reduce recidivism, for example, in the UK and the US. How it works: non-profits with demonstrated outcomes commit to a certain target for a given sum — for example, 2,500 people moved out of poverty for $2.5M dollars over three years. Private investors put up the capital (a “security”) via an intermediary. If the non-profit hits the target, philanthropists pay back the investors with a return (usually 4–5%). Donors don’t pay unless the outcome is achieved, investors bear the risk, and non-profits have access to unrestricted capital. Sama is raising growth capital though an impact security — learn more here.\n\n\n\n4. “Stakeholder capitalism” is no longer niche; it’s mainstream. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff described Schwab’s early idea that stakeholders matter more than simply shareholders as formative. Salesforce’s 1–1–1 model (1% donation of product, profit, and employee volunteer time) was directly inspired by this thinking, as is much of the benefit corporation movement. “Stakeholder capitalism” shifts the focus of business from the narrow lens of short-term shareholder profit to a broad definition of profit that includes workers, customers, and the environment — a very important factor in how Millennials work, shop, and spend time. I think in time we will expand this idea to include “giving work” rather than donating capital — addressing poverty, recidivism, and a host of other social problems by incentivizing companies to hire from marginalized populations.\n\n\n\n5. Safe harbor provisions would allow tech platforms to innovate around labor. What does a job mean today, when 40% of US workers are “contingent labor” (read: contract workers)? 50% of Uber drivers work fewer than 10 hours a week. And what about Airbnb? The founders of these companies aren’t evil — they’re probably much more socially progressive than their Wall Street counterparts. So why not allow them to test things like contributions to retirement plans, better training, and the like without forcing these companies to risk massive lawsuits for being considered employers of record? This issue came up in discussions with US Senator Mark Warner and the Markle Initiative’s Zoe Baird, who are keen to propose legislation along these lines.\n\n\nMy personal favorite moment: running into Dr. Muhammad Yunus three times — twice in the cloakroom — and talking to him about #GiveWork, the core idea behind Sama. Yunus is a legend in the Sama office for his decades-long struggle to build microfinance into a movement (and the subject of my favorite Halloween costume). I had to pinch myself.","seo_title":"Davos: It's Not Enough to Do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"davos-its-not-enough-to-do-less-bad-5-tech-and-impact-trends"},"tags":[{"_key":"XcKmjphM","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"1tC6Pi0u","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"X3YfCf7h","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Davos: It's Not Enough to Do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)"}],"slug":"ethical-ai","tagName":"Ethical AI","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/tag/[slug]","query":{"slug":"ethical-ai"},"buildId":"202899f50319881aba98bacba98f348defc1a075","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
