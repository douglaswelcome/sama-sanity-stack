How do you improve it? We go into defining, measuring, and reviewing your training data quality.","openGraphImage":null,"plaintextBody":"Data quality plays a crucial role in Machine Learning (ML) models’ performance and directly leads to your projects succeeding, failing, or going off-budget. “Garbage In Garbage Out” is a phrase commonly used in the machine learning community, which means that the training data quality ultimately determines the model’s quality.\n\nOur experience working with companies using ML has shown that the best models are based on comprehensive datasets, complete with a range of detailed labels. Unfortunately, many decision-makers still underestimate the time and resources needed to create, manage, and annotate datasets. Indeed, creating quality datasets is often one of the most expensive and time-consuming elements of building a machine learning application.\n\nBut how do you define data quality and measure it? Furthermore, how do you improve it? The answers depend on the type of problem you’re solving.\n\n\nDefining Training Data Quality in Annotation\n\nIn data annotation, we often speak of “accuracy” and “consistency”. Accuracy in data labeling measures how close the labeling is to ground-truth or how well the labeled features in the data are matching real-world conditions. Consistency refers to the degree of accuracy across the overall dataset. Are annotations consistently accurate across your datasets? Other characteristics of data quality may include completeness, integrity, reasonability, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, and accessibility.\n\nThe path to high-quality, scalable data quality always begins with a deep understanding of your project requirements, allowing you to develop well-defined annotation criteria against which to measure quality. Experienced AI-driven organizations often establish a quality rubric that describes what quality means in the context of a project. Sama’s approach is to anticipate the errors that we might see in a task and assign numerical penalty values before the annotation process starts.\n\nThe main benefit of this approach is to ensure that both your company and Sama’s team are on the same page about how quality is defined and measured. This allows our experts to create comprehensive and actionable instructions without room for interpretation and inconsistencies, saving a lot of time down the road.\n\nMeasuring Training Data Quality\n\nSeveral methods exist to help companies measure data quality. To define the correct annotation of given data, you want to start by creating annotation guidelines. On top of proposing a multi-level quality checks system, Sama’s experts have built unique know-how in efficiently designing annotation guidelines that enhance data quality.\n\nHere are some of the more common data quality measurement processes:\n\n\n1. Benchmarks or gold sets help measure how well a set of annotations from a group or individual matches the vetted benchmark established by knowledge experts or data scientists. Benchmarks tend to be the most affordable QA option since it involves the least amount of overlapping work. Benchmarks can provide a useful reference point as you continue to measure your output's quality during the project. They can also be used as test datasets to screen annotation candidates.\n\nAt Sama, Gold Tasks are used in two more ways: During training, to assess annotators and identify those ready to move into production, and once in production to generate an automated metric on quality. You can read more about Sama’s approach to gold tasks here.\n\n2. Consensus measures the percentage of agreement between multiple human or machine annotators. To calculate a consensus score, it is necessary to divide the sum of agreeing labels by the total number of labels per asset. The goal is to arrive at a consensus decision for each item. An auditor typically arbitrates any disagreement amongst the overlapped judgments. Consensus can be either performed by assigning a certain number of reviewers per data point or be automated.\n\n3. Cronbach's alpha test is an algorithm used to measure the average correlation or consistency of items in a dataset. Depending on the characteristics of research (for instance, its homogeneity), it may help quickly assess the labels’ overall reliability.\n\n4. Review is another method to measure data quality. This method is based on the review of label accuracy by a domain expert. The review is usually conducted by visually checking a limited number of labels, but some projects review all labels. Sama enables companies to easily review quality through a sampling portal: a dedicated portal providing full transparency and accountability on data quality. Your team can get full transparency on the batch’s quality and provide direct feedback to data trainers.\n\nDue to the iterative machine learning model testing and validation stages, we must keep in mind that data quality can change during a project. As you train your model or after making your solution live, you’ll probably find patterns in your inaccuracies or identify edge cases that will force you to adapt your dataset.\n\nReviewing Training Data Quality\n\nBecause no two AI projects are alike, you need to make sure that your quality assurance (QA) process is designed to meet the unique needs of your particular project. Here, both data accuracy and consistency are reviewed, separate steps that a data scientist or project manager may perform manually or in an automated way.\n\nTwo different types of QA processes:\n\nSama’s own QA managers review the tasks using both manual and automated techniques.\n\nClient’s QA process performed by a data scientist, most likely manual only.\n\nReviewing tasks is a pain point for most data science teams. We believe that your team should spend less time on these time-consuming and tedious tasks and spend more time on strategic work. As such, we created the Auto QA process. Auto QA creates an instant feedback loop to prevent logical fallacies, which helps annotators improve and get it right the first time.\n\nAutomated logic checks are triggered before a task is submitted on Sama’s platform by our annotators. Auto logic checks can identify several potential issues in your data— for instance, invalid answer combinations, repetitions, or size requirements. Leveraging Auto QA will help you prevent errors that may be impossible to detect by the manual QA review process. It reduces the time spent by manual QAs and allows annotators to focus on the more critical errors or edge cases.\n\nSama’s training data platform handles the entire annotation lifecycle and employs a quality feedback loop, enabling us to offer the highest quality SLA (\u003e95%), even on the most complex workflows. Understanding the importance and prioritizing the quality of your training data will help in achieving success with your models. The first step in gaining good quality training data begins with finding the right processes and platforms to label your training data.","seo_title":"How to Define and Measure Your Training Data Quality","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"define-and-measure-training-data-quality"},"tags":[{"_key":"aZTVAo0T","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"Wr7YIM1K","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"How to Define and Measure Your Training Data Quality"},{"_createdAt":"2021-03-23T19:00:21Z","author":{"_id":"4e2e7cef-d6eb-4bb7-bd39-375c6299677e","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1a274bcfdb5e70d814f1bab2b6bbd644728e9be-1480x1462-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"With a background in Computer Science, Abha leads the Customer Success Engineering team at Sama.

To define the correct annotation of given data, you want to start by creating annotation guidelines. On top of proposing a multi-level quality checks system, Sama’s experts have built unique know-how in efficiently designing annotation guidelines that enhance data quality.\n\nCue Gold Tasks; referring to tasks that have been annotated “perfectly” or meet the “gold standard”. Such tasks are often used by the client to communicate their expectations around precision and quality used as examples during training. At Sama, we use Gold Tasks in two more ways: During training, to assess annotators and identify those who are ready to move into production and during production to generate an automated metric on quality.\n\nGold Assessments\n\nEvery project launch at Sama is accompanied with a period of training, where annotators focus on requirements for the specific workflow, familiarizing themselves with the taxonomy, accuracy levels needed, and edge cases. Gold tasks come in as they move from classroom training to practice tasks.\n\nA gold set is created that is representative of the overall complexity of the dataset, ensuring a healthy mix of the edge cases. annotators practice on this set of which we already have “gold” answers. As each task is submitted we are able to compare the annotator answers with the gold task, generating custom metrics and error tags. The metrics are determined by the type of workflow and tool used, for e.g. in a semantic segmentation workflow, we focus on IoU calculations per label and depending on the client rubric each label may be weighed differently.\n\nThese metrics are then used to create trends and analyze each annotator’s performance individually, and provide relevant feedback. We are able to analyze trends at an asset label (which type of images are more difficult than others?), annotator level (which annotator is struggling exactly where?), and the impact of time (was today better than yesterday?).\n\nGold assessments, therefore, help us accelerate training by providing customized feedback to each annotator early on and allowing us to track their improvement over time. This enables Sama to quickly identify doubts, find edge cases, and have high confidence that annotators are ready to move on to production. Lastly, this allows us to calibrate and train the manual QAs on the specifics of this particular workflow, ensuring that nothing is missed.\n\n\nGold Metrics\n\nSimilar to gold assessments, gold metrics compare an annotator’s tasks against a known, completed task. These tasks, however, are interspersed within the production queue with the annotators unaware that these are gold tasks. These tasks then act as tests for the annotators, generating similar metrics as mentioned above. This allows the team to report upon the annotator’s performance against the gold tasks that increase insight into quality and help to further tailor training and coaching.\n\nGold metrics are most useful for clients looking to automate the quality loop on their side. Given that their Sama project team consistently samples and approves only high quality tasks, it is a neat way for them to save time and capacity.\n\nBecause no two AI projects are alike, you need to make sure that your quality assurance (QA) process is designed to meet the unique needs of your particular project.

What are automated quality accelerators and why should we care? Automated quality accelerators are technology innovations that are focused on reducing the amount of manual quality assurance time spent in QA processes. They may be used to expedite annotator education, generate automated measures of annotation quality, and prevent logical fallacies. Our accelerators are integrated into our Sama training data platform and can be customized for unique use cases and needs by our dedicated Customer Success Engineering team.\n\nWhile it’s key to have a human in the loop when creating and verifying training data, automating processes within the workflow improves efficiency while guaranteeing high quality, saving everyone time and money. Quality accelerators also focus the effort of Sama’s annotators towards the most challenging aspect of the task, minimizing the volume of manual rework they need to do, and catching mistakes early in the process —equipping them to do their job well. Ultimately, automated quality accelerators enable us to deliver super high-quality data for complex use cases in the most efficient manner.\n\n\n\nAutomated Quality Accelerators at Sama\n\nAutomated Logic Checks:\n\n\n\nAutomated Logic checks are triggered before a task is submitted on Sama by our annotators. Each task is assessed using a fixed set of rules to check for invalid combinations of labels within a shape, across all shapes, and dependencies with the metadata. These rules are flexible and customized to each workflow, focusing on all errors types that don’t need human judgement. If an error is found, the annotator needs to fix the task before it can be submitted. To help the annotator to fix the task and learn from their mistake, a message is displayed which contains shape specific error tags.\n\nAuto logic checks are optimized for different kinds of errors, including but not limited to:\n\nInvalid answer combinations: Combinations that the ontology prevents, for example more than two wheels being tagged on an item labeled “bicycle.”\n\nUniqueness or preventing repetitions: More than one object in an image being assigned the same unique identifier or the same label when the ontology prohibits that. For example, two noses in a single person keypoints workflow.\n\nSize requirements: Ensuring that size specifications are met. For example, guaranteeing consistent size in a 3D workflow where constant cuboid size is required or enforcing a minimum pixel rule\n\nRelational checks: Given attributes and sub-attributes, ensure that values selected aren’t contradictory. For example, a bicyclist polygon isn’t grouped/attached to a car bounding box\n\nThese checks are incredibly efficient for the following reasons:\n\nCreate an instant feedback loop to prevent logical fallacies, which helps annotators improve and get it right the first time\n\nPrevents errors that may be impossible to detect by a manual QA review processes\n\nReduces time spent by manual QAs and allow them to focus on the more critical errors or sample more tasks\n\nHelps annotators to adapt quickly to changing project instructions, ensuring that new instructions are being followed and are understood correctly\n\nLastly, it improves overall TPT and reduces the time from task creation to delivery\n\nUnder a strictly manual process, highly skilled quality assurance annotators would need to review and provide feedback manually. While the latter process is still a vital part of our human-in-the-loop data annotation, auto logic checks free up their expertise to focus on more subjective errors and edge cases.\n\nOur enterprise-level clients are successfully using Sama Quality Accelerators to realize extremely high data quality for their most complex use cases, improving overall model performance. Now is the time to supercharge your data quality.","seo_title":"Supercharge Your Data Quality with Automated Quality Accelerators","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"data-quality-with-auto-q-a"},"tags":[{"_key":"5AiNXS1h","label":"Product","value":"Product"},{"_key":"Izvu8Acj","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"6O3wnuJC","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"Supercharge Your Data Quality with Automated Quality Accelerators"},{"_createdAt":"2021-02-09T20:20:36Z","author":{"_id":"88e43c38-2712-41d4-9df3-8656c163c4db","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af1346669e45d7264a36f051c18aea76061725bb-1895x1894-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Kyra is passionate about world-changing tech and sustainability, and happiest when these come together (looking at you, Sama).

The criteria to choose a ML model is heavily dependent on the kind of input available. For the model to learn anything relevant, training data plays a key role. Imagine in a supervised setting, we are trying to do object recognition. If the labels themselves are messed up what would the model learn? Besides the quality, the quantity of training examples also plays a major role. Training data forms the basis of business decisions based on the offline KPIs being measured on their information. They are the building block for defining a roadmap to the product cycle.\"\n\n\nIndu Khatri\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n\n\"There are two main reasons why quality training data is important. First one is that many problems are solved using Supervised Learning and training data forms the backbone for such applications. The second and more deeper reason is that with the advent of AutoML, democratization of ML skills, and open sourcing of cutting edge research and tools; they are no longer competitive advantages. The only way businesses can sustain a competitive advantage in AI applications is through differentiated training data.\"\n\n\nLavi Nigam\nData Scientist, Gartner\n\n\"In supervised learning, algorithms are dependent on training data to extract relevant patterns for future predictability, hence clean, unbiased and processed training data is crucially important. It’s like the “garbage in garbage out” rule for training any ML/DL models. Although, sometimes, we have lack of training data available and in such cases we have many new semi-supervised learning algorithms coming up. I see great future in such techniques as businesses all across the world don't work at Google/Facebook data scales mostly.\"\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\n\n“‘Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world’. With deep learning methods, we may say ‘Give me data big enough and I can predict anything.’ Data is the foundation of Machine Learning, especially the deep learning method, with the machines learning everything from data. If you feed a machine biased data, it gives you biased predictions. Garbage in, garbage out.”\n\n\nShuo Zhang\nSenior ML Engineer, Bose Corporation\n\n“One point I'd like to stress is the domain knowledge and domain specificity in ML. People sometimes think of ML as a ubiquitous technology that can be universally applied to any domain. But in reality, blindly applying ML is dangerous, and you should always know your domain and your data in a very deep way.”\n\n\nPiero Molino\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\n\n\"How would you train models without it? More seriously, quality and size of data are important because we are trying to tackle difficult tasks and we haven't figured out yet methods that are very robust to noise or that can be trained from smaller amounts of data.\"\n\n\nSparkle R. \nAssociate Director Data Science, Johnson \u0026 Johnson\n\n\"While innovative ML tools and techniques are being developed at a rapid pace, ML practitioners can sometimes get drawn into the novelty of applying newer approaches without realizing that the fundamentals of science and lack of high-quality data make many of these algorithms impractical for some healthcare facing solutions. Additionally, in our haste to publish our findings, researchers often forget that these systems will be used by an end-user (patient and provider), and expert level performance in development does not guarantee real-world clinical utility, adoption and transferability across heterogeneous healthcare systems. So, it is equally important that the end user’s workflow is also considered to ensure that the lab to real world transition is successful.\"\n\n\nYaman Kumar\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\n\n\"Training data is so important since most of the people, books, blogs, videos start and end with supervised learning. We currently do not know how to work in unsupervised settings. As we move towards unsupervised settings, the requirement of training data as we know it will reduce. In that world, gathering training data would not be an arduous task as it is supposed to be now.\"\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi\nArtificial Intelligence \u0026 Computer Science, University of Florida\n\n\"Training data is the backbone of any machine learning system, without sufficient training data, it is impossible for a machine to learn patterns or solve problems. The importance of training data illustrates why inadequate, or low quality training data, could lead to Machine Learning systems’ failure. Training data ought to be representative of all different groups within the sample without inheriting any societal prejudices.\"\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems \u0026 Strategy Lab\n\n\"I feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\"","seo_title":"10 Experts Give Reasons Why High-Quality Training Data is so Important","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"experts-high-quality-training-data-importance"},"tags":[{"_key":"HWRhI8n2","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"QPqXb7Bo","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"deOuCKuN","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"10 Experts Give Reasons Why High-Quality Training Data is so Important"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-15T20:16:49Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

We’re certainly betting on it: global spend on AI is predicted to be a whopping $98 Billion by 2023, up from 37.5 Billion in 2019. But we’re still in the early days when it comes to fulfilling the promise of AI and one of the reasons is training data—the annotated data a machine needs to learn to see or hear. Training data is essential to the development of any machine learning model. A global survey of Data Scientists, AI Experts and Stakeholders revealed that 8 out of 10 AI projects fail and 96% run into problems with data quality and labeling. \n\nEven applications now leading the scene have had their fair share of mishaps along the way. We’ve listed some examples of when AI might not have been performing at its best.\n\n\n\n1. The Somewhat Vulgar Virtual Assistant\n\nIt only took 24 hours for Tay, Microsoft's new conversational understanding chatbot, to start tweeting some extremely insensitive and offensive material online. The initial idea was to have Tay learn through ‘casual conversation’ with fellow Twitter users, which perhaps, at that time, was too far-fetched. While a majority of the 100k+ tweets were not considered to be eyebrow-raising, a selection of mimicking and extremely offensive posts saw Tay taken down after just one day. Unfortunately, the follow-up chatbot, ‘Zo’ resulted in the same fate, albeit after five months of live interaction.\n\n\n\n2. IBM Watson for Oncology\n\nMany see AI as the future of medicine, but it’s been suggested that IBMs Watson for Oncology initially over-promised and underdelivered with misdiagnosis, incorrect drug treatment offerings and unsafe judgement calls on patients. While there was and still is promise, the current ‘messy’ state of healthcare systems and mismatch between both the working and learning styles of doctors and machines became evident. Watson Oncology, however, continues to improve, with memory banks of every rare disease, increasing knowledge and a lack of cognitive bias potentially held by long serving medical professionals.\n\n\n\n3. Amazon AI Bias Recruitment\n\nNow scrapped, the once used AI recruiting tool from Amazon was found to be perpetuating the gender gap in tech jobs. The initial hope for a perfect filtration system for the top applications, was soon found to host significant bias towards hiring men due to being trained on resumes submitted in previous years—which were predominantly from male applicants. The use of historical data which facilitated existing bias has seen great advancements in regard to hiring diverse talent, but continues to have a long road ahead.\n\n\n\n4. Purchasing on Alexa\n\nResearch suggests that by 2023 over eight billion voice assistants will be present in consumers' lives. We predict many of these will be subject of, or susceptible to, some humorous moments while in development. We have seen doll houses ordered through ads on television (oops!), parrots casually chatting with Alexa, hacking issues, and all sorts. There is no doubt that the virtual assistant has further developed to a more accurate level since, but we’re excited for the future of viral YouTube videos to come.\n\n\n\n5. Insurance company uses social media data to issue rates, shows bias\n\nAdmiral Insurance, a popular company for first-time drivers, aimed to embed AI to analyse the Facebook data of those applying for insurance as they claimed there was a ‘proven link’ between personality and their driving style or ability. Facebook was quick to stop any advancements in this due to underlying ethical concerns, data privacy and potential bias of models.\n\nWhile AI carries a lot of promise, it also carries a lot of hype. When it comes to AI, your model is only as good as the data it’s trained on, because here applies: garbage in, garbage out.","seo_title":"The Training Data Challenge: 5 AI Fails","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-training-data-challenge-5-ai-fails"},"tags":[{"_key":"3firrVWY","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"93GN7laV","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"WeyhHs1O","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"The Training Data Challenge: 5 AI Fails"},{"_createdAt":"2020-05-12T16:08:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

And unlike human-driven cars, AVs rely solely on their computer vision system and the data used to train them to navigate the world around us.\n\nCurrently, the best self-driving assistance systems incorrectly perceive something in their environment once every tens of thousands of hours. If that object is a traffic light, and the car gets it wrong, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., are all at risk. Here’s a look at the traffic light problem for autonomous cars from three perspectives. \n\n\n\n1. Traffic lights tell road users when to stop and go, but they only work when everyone follows the rules.\n\nTraffic lights are an engineered system, timed around traffic patterns. There are rules in place that tell cars when to stop and go, but the inherent human behavior of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists sometimes means these rules are loosely interpreted.\n\nThere are no physical barriers forcing road users to abide by traffic signals. They work because drivers follow the rules. AVs must also get the rules right, and that means countless hours of real-world exposure to the unspoken rules (or lack thereof) of the road.\n\nThe quality and accuracy of the data received from sensor packages must be precise, leaving no room for interpretation or inconsistencies. Also, license plates, faces or other personal identifying information (PII) may need to be anonymized to protect the privacy of people who might appear in the raw footage. \n\nEnsuring AVs learn the right rules requires unbiased, appropriately labeled and high-quality training data based on a range of driving scenarios.\n\n\n\n2. Traffic lights challenge both the vision system and the team developing the algorithms.\n\nBecause traffic lights are not a distance detection problem, AVs cannot use lidar or radar to navigate traffic signals. They must rely solely on their computer vision system to understand when to stop and go.\n\nThis can be difficult for both the vision system as well as the team developing the algorithm because the visibility of traffic lights may vary based on weather conditions like bright sunlight, rain, snow or fog. Similarly, not all intersections have traffic lights, so if the AV doesn’t detect one, that could be correct.\n\nThe treatment of out of service traffic signals can also vary. One city might use a plastic bag to indicate an out-of-service light while another city, or even county, might use masking tape or some other method to cover broken traffic signals.\n\nContext clues like head nods or hand signals help human drivers manage low visibility or the lack of a traffic light, but since AVs cannot register this supplemental visual information, machine learning and computer vision engineers must train the AV on such scenarios as they arise.\n\n3. Stock datasets aren’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely.\n\nThe volume and diversity of data required for autonomous vehicles is vast, and stock datasets cannot cover all use cases.\n\nDuncan Curtis, Sama VP of Product shares approximately 1,000 to 10,000 images are needed to deploy a solution onto a vehicle, and in order to launch a product publicly, approximately 10,000 to 100,000 images are needed per ADAS feature. That’s a lot of data, and the amount of data needed to account for edge cases like traffic lights in unique road conditions is unknown.\n\nSince AVs often need data from a specific camera or sensor package (because that’s what the car will use in production), generic stock data isn’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely. In addition to this, models need to be refreshed with ongoing training data as road rules, and the world around us changes.\n\nOur team of data labeling experts annotate over 4M tasks per month, and for AV use cases, we’ve achieved 99.5 percent quality SLAs with more than 100 tags per image. We’ve also successfully achieved full productivity within our labeling teams in as little as two to five days.\n\nIf you need ground truth data for your ML model, connect with our team for a virtual consultation and demo of our industry-leading data annotation platform.","seo_title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-traffic-light-problem-for-autonomous-vehicles"},"tags":[{"_key":"ivLPY6Ly","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"Liw4Inz5","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"3LVFK315","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"YhUSiZyI","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"72HsQzsx","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles"},{"_createdAt":"2020-02-04T22:15:39Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

And as more organizations develop their own AI and ML programs, the necessity of superior quality data is even more pertinent.\n\nImpact of Biased Data in Computer Vision\n\nAI bias can creep in at any stage of the training data lifecycle, and bias presents itself most commonly in three categories: dataset bias, training bias and algorithmic bias.\n\nDataset bias is as you might expect—the data does not provide enough information for the model to learn the problem, or it’s unrepresentative of reality in some way. Training bias is the result of poor quality or inconsistent data labeling, and lastly, algorithmic bias occurs when the algorithm itself makes poor predictions or produces poor results.\n\nModels trained on biased data not only produce inaccurate algorithms, they also present ethical, legal and safety problems. And in some cases, biased data in computer vision can perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender.\n\nLeft unchecked, algorithms trained on biased data greatly impact the lives of people using the very technologies meant to enhance their everyday experiences.\n\n\n\nCountering Bias in Training Data\n\nCountering bias in training data starts by having an effective training data strategy.\n\nLast year at Embedded Vision Summit, I presented a talk on practical training data strategies to avoid bias, sharing four ways to mitigate unwanted bias in training data. \n\nI want to echo my thoughts here that an effective training data strategy makes for a strong defense against AI bias. Fighting bias in training data means determining your data needs, developing training rules to cover known uses cases, and diversifying data to cover edge cases.\n\nAs your model learns, countering bias means evolving rules and sourcing more data when needed—all while keeping apprised of legal and ethical sourcing considerations.\n\nObtaining Superior Quality Datasets\n\nTop organizations understand that if they want smarter models, they need ethically sourced, quality data (https://www.samasource.com/quality-scale). Your quality requirements might vary, depending on your model, but the fact remains that diverse, high-quality data helps counter AI bias.\n\nFor over a decade, hundreds of organizations, including 25% of the Fortune 50 have relied on Samasource to deliver secure, high-quality training data and model validation for machine learning.\n\nWe’ve helped organizations like Walmart improve their retail item coverage, and others like Vulcan Inc., improve turnaround time to process training datasets. We’ve even partnered with organizations like Cornell Tech to produce an open-source dataset of our own. \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when sourcing superior quality datasets:\n\nBe aware of local privacy and property laws as you collect data.\n\nEnsure you have legal user consent for data capture.\n\nStay informed of the security protocols of facilities processing your training data.\n\nWhen possible, stay informed of the working conditions of the workers labeling your data, and support that pay living wages and benefits.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Samasource securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech, and if your goal is to build smarter AI, contact our team to discuss your training data needs. ","seo_title":"Fighting AI Bias by Obtaining High-Quality Training Data","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fighting-ai-bias-by-obtaining-high-quality-training-data"},"tags":[{"_key":"JOSMV7ei","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"X1b43vej","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"zoYY0bth","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"8v2jDpFA","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"Fighting AI Bias by Obtaining High-Quality Training Data"},{"_createdAt":"2019-07-11T22:00:00Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

Train a Proof-of-Concept ASAP to Determine Data Needs\n\nThe feedback gained from a proof-of-concept (POC) model provides the necessary insight to estimate how much data is needed to achieve level 4 maturity. Don’t wait until you have the “right” amount of data, or an all-encompassing data content scope.\n\nAllow the results of your POC to drive the need for more data and refine, expand and improve as unknown use cases and edge cases surface.\n\n2. Set Clear Training Data Rules to Cover Edge Cases\n\nEdge cases should not be an afterthought, but rather a key component of your training data strategy. Objects may have many different names e.g., Is it a scooter? Or a small moped? Or, perhaps a mini motorbike?\n\nDefine clear classification rules for subjective and specific objects, and set objective rules to determine their class. These training data rules will help you cover edge cases effectively.\n\n3. Choose Your Training Data Partner Wisely\n\nImpact and sustainability have become increasingly more important corporate values. Consider partnering with a training data supplier that utilizes an ethical supply chain like Sama.\n\nOur directly managed workforce has annotated over one million images on Sama, and we’ve helped partners like General Motors and Volkswagen achieve high-quality data at scale with our training data expertise.\n\nBottom line is your actions have impact. Not only will an ethically minded training data strategy lead to higher quality results, you’ll be making a difference in communities near and far.\n\n4. Test Your Model for Bias\n\nIn addition to lower precision, models trained on biased data can have ethical, legal and safety problems. For example, data biased toward pedestrians with lighter skin may cause the model to identify pedestrians with darker skin less accurately. \n\nYou will almost always have overrepresentation of some elements and underrepresentation of others, and thoughtfully testing your model for bias before, after and throughout production will help move your model to maturity.\n\n\n\n5. Continuously Evolve Your Model\n\nModel training is never done. Every day, the world is changing around you. New cars, new fashions, etc., require newly sourced and labeled training data. According to McKinsey Global Institute 1 out of 3 AI systems require model refresh at least monthly and sometimes daily. In cases where your model is weak, treat the occurrence like a bug that needs to be fixed and continuously evolve your model.\n\nAchieving 100% accuracy can feel a lot like approaching the speed of light, and while 100% accuracy isn’t necessary for all algorithms (like chatbots), level 4 maturity is the goal automotive OEMs are striving for.\n\nKirk’s presentation, “Warp “Driving” Approaching AI’s Speed of Light,” urged attendees to be relentless in seeking out weak scenarios to train with new data.\n\nHis key takeaway was training and validation for machine learning may require different precision thresholds and volumes depending on the stage of maturity. If you want to get your AV machine learning model toward 100% accuracy, success will come from being quality-focused and iterative.\n\n","seo_title":"Moving Toward Level 4 Autonomous Driving","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"https://www.sama.com/blog/moving-toward-level-4-autonomous-driving"},"tags":[{"_key":"3KIYoFV1","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"bPng3xAl","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"TRiIb7nw","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"KO7eeuZJ","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"Moving Toward Level 4 Autonomous Driving"}],"morePosts":[{"_createdAt":"2018-03-30T22:32:27Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1fd7fbcc4633299cdbedddba22cb44e24f17317-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

While we do assist in data collection, most of the time clients come to us with data in need of enhancement, annotation, and more.\n\nWhere does the data come from? Well, data collection varies widely, so in this post we’ll look into the most common questions around this topic.\n\nData collection is a systematic strategy for gathering and measuring information from a variety of sources to get an accurate picture about a specific area of interest. The collection of various data points allows your company to answer specific questions, evaluate potential outcomes, and make predictions about future possibilities and trends.\n\nData is powerful. However, it’s not only about having the data, but also about knowing how to capture the right information — and then understanding how to use it effectively.\n\nA decision based on data rather than intuition brings success rates up by as much as 79 percent. But what is data collection, what can you do with it, and what is the potential impact to your business?\n\n\nData Collection: Understanding Why It Matters\n\nSuccessful businesses have always relied on some type of data. Yet the difference between businesses of the past and those of today is that the sheer volume of data available has rapidly expanded. Having more data empowers these leaders to tap into insights that were difficult to harness in the past.\n\nBut why is data collection so important? Here are a few of the major reasons.\n\nData is the backbone of solid decisions. Data arms you with the details required to make results-driven decisions. For example, let’s say that you need to restock inventory. One approach is to restock based on general insights and anecdotal details from sales staff. An even better strategy, however, is to tap into the data, gather insights and truly understand what is in short supply and any future trends that may make an impact.\n\nData assists with solving complex challenges. For example, let’s say that you’re planning an upcoming sales promotion and want to feature a specific product. An educated guess will tell you which product might be a good fit for a specific market segment, but data provides an even better option, one that is more accurate. Using analytics, you could view previous purchasing patterns and determine that preferences are leaning toward an entirely different product; performing this analysis saves you time and money.\n\nData assists with improving processes. Perhaps you want to understand why one department performs better than another. Data can help you dig deeper to get a more accurate picture of what’s going on with each department and the factors at play, and then come up with an effective solution so that other departments perform just as well.\n\n\nWhat Type of Data is Most Important to Collect?\n\nWhen you're trying to understand data collection, it helps to better define the pieces of information that must be gathered. The problem isn’t having enough data; there are vast amounts of data for your company to collect, harvest and use to gain valuable insights to run a more profitable business. So the question is actually what type of data do you want?\n\nFor example, let’s say that you own a retail store and you want to better understand how customers are moving through the store. Viewing the paths that customers take to purchase various products would allow you to more accurately anticipate customers’ needs and place the correct merchandising along those paths. Some companies even leverage data collected via GPS through apps in which customers consent to the collection, and the data is available to learn more about customers’ behaviors and preferences.\n\nOr maybe you want to learn more about online shopping patterns for specific segments. For example, how many products and what types of products do customers look at prior to their final purchases? If so, you might collect data points along the buying journey to glean relevant insights and ultimately improve the customer experience.\n\nUltimately, the first step in deciding what data to collect is determining what you want to learn. Because there is a vast amount of data to collect, you must know which “bread crumbs” to follow; otherwise, you’ll be lost.\n\n\nWhat are the Potential Benefits of Effective Data Collection?\n\nThe results of collecting, analyzing and gaining insights from big data are significant. For companies that use big data, 92 percent of executives report being satisfied with the results and 89 percent rate big data as very or extremely important. In fact, 89 percent of those surveyed in a report conducted by General Electric said that lack of big data adoption creates risk of losing market share.\n\nThe effects of accurately collecting the right data apply to a variety of business areas, such as customer service, which has the potential to create much stronger bonds between the company and the customer. For example, Delta Airlines uses big data to tackle one of the biggest fears of travelers: lost baggage.\n\nThe company checks over 130 million bags each year, and it also became the first airline that allowed customers to track luggage via their mobile devices. The tracking application has been downloaded over 11 million times and uses data to help customers relieve the anxiety that comes with the worry of losing important baggage.\n\nThis is just one example of the positive impact that data collection can have, but there are many more, all of which have the potential to create changes in a business that make customers feel truly known and improve your bottom line. In many cases, the data is already there, so all you must do is seek it out, glean insights from it, and start reaping the rewards.\n\nIf your company needs help with data collection, Sama is here for you.\n\nOur services help our many clients achieve their business goals while also changing the lives of our workers, who earn a living wage and lift themselves out of poverty.\n\nContact Sama today to learn more about our data services.","seo_title":"What is Data Collection and Why Do You Care?","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"what-is-data-collection-and-why-do-you-care"},"tags":[{"_key":"E5C8tuMS","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"nEjDa8yW","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"What is Data Collection and Why Do You Care?"}],"slug":"data-quality","tagName":"Data Quality","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/tag/[slug]","query":{"slug":"data-quality"},"buildId":"23bae808796e2dc49a70ed7adbfd60d12edac143","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[4941,425,3551],"gsp":true,"appGip":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
