For example, Amazon uses artificial intelligence to make adjustments in delivery routes and arrival times.\n\nOther retailers like Gap are also using a combination of human effort and automation (https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18526092/amazon-warehouse-robotics-automation-ai-10-years-away) to perform dynamic product picking in shipping warehouses. \n\nResearch continues on how to fully automate shipping warehouses, but it’s this level of human-in-the-loop AI (https://www.sama.com/samahub-platform)that shows great promise for e-commerce enterprises.\n\nWorking together, humans and machines can find ways to deliver customer orders with efficiency, providing a stark competitive advantage to companies who adopt AI as part of their operational roadmap.\n\nPut Product Recommendations on Autopilot\n\nA product recommendation engine allows you to suggest products uniquely suited for your buyers. Think of this algorithm as the digital substitute for brick and mortar store clerks who guide shoppers to relevant and similar products.\n\nOur work with Walmart contributes to the accuracy of their product recommendations, and we’ve also helped Getty’s Images catalog stock photos based on key attributes, to support the foundation of its recommendation engine.\n\nRecommendation engines help you up-sell, cross-sell and otherwise inspire customers to bundle offers and create custom solutions best suited for their needs, and according to a McKinsey report, Amazon’s AI-powered recommendation engine was responsible for 35 percent (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) of the company's revenue. \n\nIn addition to product recommendations, artificial intelligence can automate post-purchase activities like accurately timed repurchasing messages, so your buyers are their most ready to buy.\n\nCreate Immersive Customer Experiences\n\nToday’s always-connected consumer shops from multiple devices, putting seamless customer experiences at the core of driving customer engagement.\n\nA recent study showed that about two-thirds of shoppers (https://www.emarketer.com/content/two-thirds-of-internet-users-check-phones-in-store-for-product-information-skipping-store-associates) check their phone in-store for product information e.g. looking up product reviews, comparing prices, etc. Whether it’s to send targeted and relevant messaging and ads, or to enable real-world product scanning, e-commerce needs AI, in order to create immersive customer experiences at scale. \n\nWhen we work with companies that want to use AI in e-commerce, we notice a few common barriers in AI adoption, such as a lack of training data strategy, lack of talent and/or platform to get started with AI and a lack of high-quality data to properly train AI algorithms.\n\nIf any of these barriers are stopping you from implementing AI across your organization, we can help. Helping e-commerce enterprises keep up with the demand for personalization, while driving the best level of digital classification, i.e., enabling the maximum/optimal experience for users to describe and see what they are shopping for, is what we do.\n\nContact us (https://www.samasource.com/contact-us) to learn more about accelerating your ML pipeline with high-quality training data from Sama.\n\n\n","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-compelling-reasons-to-use-ai-in-e-commerce"},"tags":[{"_key":"DCGPNa4P","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"KwAtlFPO","label":"Best of","value":"Best of"},{"_key":"1uBvx190","label":"Use Cases","value":"Use Cases"},{"_key":"Cryu3t8R","label":"E-Commerce","value":"E-Commerce"}],"title":"4 Compelling Reasons to Use AI in E-commerce"},{"_createdAt":"2019-10-31T19:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

This addition of on-the-go shoe sizing further showcases a pivot across the e-commerce industry toward immersive customer experiences both online and offline.\n\n\n\n3 Benefits of AR in E-commerce\n\nImproved Shopping Experiences\n\nWith AR, e-commerce enterprises have an opportunity to remove online shopping objections like product fit from the equation, resulting in improved shopping experiences for buyers. Online shoe shopping is a prime example, given how shoe sizing can vary from one brand to another.\n\nThe Nike app is said to measure each foot \"within 2 millimeters of accuracy\" and suggest a size based on the style of shoe you’re looking at, which ideally takes the guesswork out of buying shoes online.\n\n\n\nIncreased Buyer Confidence\n\nA general consensus is that Nike shoes run small in most styles, making it difficult for new customers to buy into the brand sight unseen, while making existing advocates think twice about trying new styles from a brand they love. AR provides an avenue for shoppers to find their “perfect fit” whether it’s shoes, clothes, makeup, or even jewelry.\n\nTake Brilliant Earth for example. The company is widely known for its conflict free diamonds, and its mobile user experience for engagement ring shopping includes a virtual try on option powered by AR.\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Brilliant Earth’s AR toolkit in action.\n\n\n\nEven Shopify, a go-to e-commerce platform for established and aspiring brands has made the move to offer AR as a part of their seller toolkit.\n\nThis shows that engaging with shoppers is more than just proactive customer service and two-way conversations—it’s about increasing confidence among buyers by giving them a truer sense of the size, scale and detail of your product.\n\n\n\nHuman-to-Machine Enabled Product Improvements\n\nArguably the most exciting thing about Nike’s AR-enabled app is the potential for human-to-machine collaboration on product improvements.\n\nNike expressed it would be integrating what it learns about customer shoe size as a primary feature for measuring shoes. Over time, this could lead to production improvements based on cumulative measurement data from the app and purchase data from people with similar sized feet.\n\nYes—AR presents an exciting opportunity for the retail industry, but it also marks an era where humans and machines can work together to shape and mold the world around us.\n\nPHOTO: Nike App with AR via The Verge\n\n\n\nIn a time where a 90’s animated series can be turned into an AR-enabled game, and bring people together in droves, artificial intelligence can prove to be a unique competitive advantage.\n\nIn fact, 45 percent of consumers surveyed said they would try AR, and an additional 30 percent reported “they would never go to another clothing store again if AR would allow them to buy the right size clothing with confidence.”\n\nThe market opportunity for AR in e-commerce is promising, however, AI requires a solid foundation of data to be effective, and if that data quality is compromised, so are your algorithms.\n\nAccording to Mckinsey Global Institute, 1 out of 3 use cases for retraining AI systems requires a model refresh at least monthly, and sometimes daily.\n\nNike’s insistence on human-to-machine learning is a signal that continuously refreshed, quality data is needed in order to deliver on the personalized experiences expected of the retail industry.\n\nFor years, Sama has delivered turnkey, high-quality training data and validation to train the world's leading AI technologies.
