As DevOps, we would ideally like all our colleagues to easily have access to the same tools and environments, and to even extend that to our CI/CD pipelines, which have no reason to run different versions of those tools from our development machines.\n\nContainers are a natural go-to for the job. However, while they're great at encapsulating many tools with specific versions and repeatable, predictable outcomes, containers are designed with remote services and jobs in mind, rather than day-to-day use as a local work environment.\n\nWhen you start to use containers as a daily working tool, you quickly stumble on many roadblocks. You need to master Docker CLI commands and flags to launch your container in various conditions, environment variables, volume mounts and port mappings. The syntax is different depending if you already started your container in the past, or if it's already running and you just want to open a few extra shells into it. What if you need to access multiple kubernetes clusters in parallel, each with its own container? And don't forget that if you modify any config files within your container, those will be discarded the next time you rebuild and launch a fresh copy of your image! Finally, if you want to share the same tools and configs with your colleagues and (gasp!) even your CI/CD pipeline, you're in for an extra ride!\n\nNaively patching up some Dockerfile with your desired tools is not the end of the road. For us, it was just the beginning.\n\n\nThe Process\n\nWe have long tinkered with the idea of packaging up a neat multi-purpose Docker container that would handle most use cases and make it seamless to setup and interact with different Kubernetes clusters. Starting with a few prototypes and then some inspiration from Cloud Posse's Geodesic container—which does a great job of streamlining the installation and launching of the container— our experiments finally evolved into a tool generic and mature enough to be shared with the community!\n\nOur goal has been to share such a tool with the DevOps community and, thanks to the folks at Sama, this vision has become a reality. Let me introduce you to an MIT-licensed, open source, kubernetes-oriented, general purpose docker container for devs/devops and custom CI/CD pipelines, that we affectionately called \"Factotum\" (from Latin, basically meaning an employee who does all kinds of work).\n\nCheck out the source on GitHub\n\nWhat to Know Before You Begin\n\nEven if you can try the vanilla build of Factotum as is from GitHub and Docker Hub, please understand that Factotum is really intended to be customized and made your own in order to leverage its full potential. If you settle to try it, it is worth forking the repo, customizing the Dockerfile and following the instructions in README.md. While that process of setting up your own customized build of Factotum can be rather involved, be assured that using, maintaining, upgrading and sharing it with your teammates afterwards is intended to be as straightforward as possible—it just takes that little initial effort! And, if you encounter any issues or can't figure how to set it up correctly, don't hesitate to file an issue in the GitHub repo and give us feedback.\n\nHappy factotum'ing.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"devops-tools-for-cloud-native-engineering"},"tags":[{"_key":"8AQmCtzZ","label":"Sama Engineering","value":"Sama Engineering"},{"_key":"Gl5fCrPJ","label":"Featured","value":"Featured"}],"title":"Factotum: Containerizing DevOps Tools for Cloud Native Engineering and CI/CD"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-19T17:04:40Z","author":{"_id":"7aaa2439-b7e5-45f9-8aee-1fbf3c9b5fb8","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-0a1ace27b14b286beed42f8a189b8d4c9f8d5e71-512x512-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Dimitri is a software developer specializing in computer vision.

It's therefore usually not performed locally. One of the challenges when it comes to launching training jobs on the cloud or private GPU clusters is dealing with all the required manual steps. For example, when using AWS, ML engineers need to spin-up an EC2 instance manually to launch a training job, and then manually decommission it once the training job is completed. \n\nAlthough commercial tools do exist to automate this process (for example, SageMaker or DataBricks), at Sama we decided to build our own automated training pipeline in order to limit costs, and to avoid tying ourselves to a particular cloud provider.\n\nOur pipeline allows our ML Engineers and Scientists to launch a training job on the cloud by simply pushing the code they developed locally to a predefined git branch. This is very simple to achieve using a modern CI/CD platform like Codefresh. A Codefresh “trigger” can be set to track commits to specific git branches of a repository. Once a commit is pushed to a target branch, a Codefresh pipeline is triggered. The pipeline is just a workflow defined in a yaml file that executes the following steps :\n\nClone the tracked git repository, as well as any other repos required (in our case we have a separate repo for all our ML related tools).\n\nBuild a Docker image with all the project specific dependencies.\n\nDeploy the training job on the GPU cluster.\n\nSend a slack message to a channel that tracks all the training jobs whenever the results are ready or if there is an error.\n\nThe specific implementation of step 3 above depends on the particular frameworks and libraries that are used to train the models and track their performance, as well as the cloud provider. In our team, we use Kubernetes to orchestrate the creation and decommission of the instances. We also use mlflow to manage the ML lifecycle, which has built-in Kubernetes deployment support. So for us, this step simply reduces to doing some cloud provider specific configuration and running an mlflow experiment with Kubernetes as the backend.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Sama automated training pipeline: from pushing the code to Github to running the training job on AWS.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious time savings, the advantage of this setup is that it is fully configurable and can be made to work with any cloud provider, or even a private GPU cluster. As an added bonus, it enforces experiments to be separated in different git commits, which we find is good practice.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"part-1-automating-model-training-on-the-cloud"},"tags":[{"_key":"OdrqBpR4","label":"Sama Engineering","value":"Sama Engineering"},{"_key":"Yw0P8Jjj","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"08tVZdgm","label":"MLOps","value":"MLOps"},{"_key":"eMmu9s8R","label":"Featured","value":"Featured"}],"title":"The Sama MLOps Pipeline: Automating Model Training on the Cloud"},{"_createdAt":"2020-12-15T21:43:21Z","author":{"_id":"a3099d34-9595-4978-b517-e508196414c1","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-6643136d6c33f77b8e49366c166642ca5dafba8d-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Frédéric is a researcher and team leader with over 15 years of R&D experience in machine learning, AI, NLP, speech recognition, and computer vision.

This is especially true for projects involving autonomous vehicles, where it is typical to apply instance segmentation to label scenes comprising hundreds of frames, each with multiple objects (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.) like you see in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1. Example of Polygonal Annotation in Sama.\n\n\n\nIn this post, we summarize an approach that we have developed to speed up polygonal instance segmentation using machine learning. This approach was presented earlier this year at the CVPR Workshop on Scalability in Autonomous Driving, and the ICML Workshop on Human-in-the-Loop Learning.\n\nFew-Click Annotation\n\nBuilding instance segmentation Deep Learning (DL) models for autonomous vehicles requires a significant amount of labeled data. The use of Machine Learning (ML) for producing pre-annotations to be reviewed by human annotators, whether in an interactive setting or as a pre-processing procedure, is a very popular approach for scaling up labeling while controlling the costs.\n\nMultiple approaches have been suggested for machine-assisted instance segmentation. These typically consist of a DL-based segmentation of the object(s) integrated into a human-in-the-loop system. The human can interact with the system by correcting the model output, initializing the model with one or several clicks, or a combination of those steps. Examples of such systems include Polygon-RNN++ [1], DELSE [7], DEXTR [3], and CurveGCN [2]. Those systems all present good results, but some open questions remain:\n\nDo these methods perform well when a production-level accuracy is required, as when working for a customer project?\n\nDoes the choice of annotation tool influence the results? The gains to be made by using ML depend on how difficult it is for humans to draw polygons in the provided UI. Here we used our optimized drawing tool for polygons, which is part of our labeling platform.\n\nML integration is not usually approached from a human-centric perspective. Beyond the optimization of traditional metrics like IoU, what interactions are most desirable and how should we present the output of the model to annotators?\n\nOur method relies on combining the well-known DEXTR [3] approach with a raster-to-polygon algorithm, to make the result more easily editable. This is not unlike what other tools (such as CVAT) have implemented, though we have optimized this approach for our specific use cases using A/B testing.\n\nThe Model\n\nOur instance segmentation model is based on the well-known Deep Extreme Cut (DEXTR) approach [3], along with a raster-to-polygon conversion algorithm that yields high quality polygons whose vertices are sampled in a way that reproduces human drawing patterns. The model uses the few clicks provided by human annotators at inference time. The steps are described in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. An overview of the approach.\n\n\n\nRegarding the model itself, we adopted a custom version of the UNet [5] along with an EfficientNet backbone [6] (instead of the ResNet backbone used in the paper).\n\nIn our experience, for human annotators to produce good instance segmentation masks efficiently, a polygon annotation tool should be used. As such, we needed to convert the raster masks produced by our model to high quality polygons. To add to the challenge, humans tend to produce sparse polygons, adding vertices only when necessary. We therefore adopted a raster-to-polygon procedure that minimizes the number of output vertices.\n\nA/B Testing the Approach\n\nAt Sama, we use A/B testing as much as possible to systematically refine and improve our new features. To this end, we have developed a flexible testing infrastructure that can ingest and aggregate data from multiple internal processes and is made available to anyone within the organization.\n\nThis framework measures the statistical impact of proposed changes on our efficiency metrics (such as drawing time or shape adjustment time). The significance of observed differences on a given efficiency metric is evaluated using statistical tests.\n\nToy A/B Tests\n\nWe conducted an A/B test of the method using a synthetic automotive dataset called SYNTHIA-AL [8]. The dataset's images and corresponding annotations were generated from video streams at 25 frames per second (FPS). Figure 3 shows SYNTHIA image examples, along with their segmentation (done manually and with the Few-Click tool).\n\nFigure 3. SYNTHIA example images, along with their manual and semi-automated annotations.\n\n\n\nThe test, applied only to motor vehicles, reproduced realistic annotation guidelines, namely:\n\nThe drawn polygon needs to be within 2 pixels of the edge of the vehicle.\n\nAll vehicles down to 10 pixels (height or width) need to be annotated.\n\nFollowing this test, we found a nearly 3-fold reduction in annotation time. On the other hand, we also found that on some of the more complex shapes, annotators were spending quite some time manually adjusting the ML output. DEXTR's authors originally showed that the segmentation can be improved with additional clicks beyond the four initial ones. We therefore extended our few-click tool to allow online refinement of the polygons by considering modifications to their vertices as extra clicks. At train time we simulated the corrective clicks by considering the point of greatest deviation between predicted mask and ground truth as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nProblem: DEXTR’s 4 extreme clicks are not always sufficient.\n\nObservation: DEXTR trained on 4 clicks benefits from additional clicks.\n\nSolution: Fine-tune DEXTR model with additional clicks for hard samples as established by IoU at train time.\n\nFigure 4. Integrating additional clicks in the training process.\n\n\n\nUsing this method, annotators are able to re-trigger the model inference with an additional click, instead of manually adjusting the output. We proceeded to a second toy A/B test, and results showed that we could obtain a theoretical efficiency gain of up to 3.5x on vehicles using the improved method.\n\nDownload our paper on Human-Centric Efficiency Improvements in Image Annotation for Autonomous Driving here and stay tuned to hear more about our latest advances!\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAcuna, D., Ling, H., Kar, A., and Fidler, S.
