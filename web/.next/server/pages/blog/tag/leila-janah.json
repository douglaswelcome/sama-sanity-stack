Our technology has quickly become the preferred option by some of the most sophisticated companies in the world. I know Leila would be proud to see where our company is today and that we are finally sharing Sama, a name we’ve used internally for years, with the world.\n\nIf there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that 2020 was a tumultuous year. From a deadly pandemic to global protests and a national presidential election - its events are sure to impact our society for years and decades to come.\n\nAs many of you know, our founder, Leila Janah, passed away following a battle with epithelioid cancer. Since then, we’ve worked to fulfill her legacy through technological innovation, navigated the challenges of COVID-19, and stepped up to address the ongoing challenges of bias in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nDespite its challenges, 2020 was a year of milestones and achievements for our team. From our recognition on the Inc. 5000 list as one of North America’s fastest-growing private companies to launching our Machine Learning Assisted Annotation, we look back on 2020 with an overall optimism for the future.\n\nSama reflects several business developments we’ve made over the past few years. Starting with our transition to a for-profit business model in 2018, we’ve been focused on scaling our business to continue to provide high-quality training data for ambitious AI for some of the world’s leading brands such as Google, NVIDIA, and Walmart.\n\nSince transitioning our business model, we’ve streamlined our approach to focus on accuracy, consistency, and simplicity, launching solutions like PII Data Anonymizer and Machine Learning Assisted Annotation. These solutions leverage automation in addition to human oversight, allowing efficient yet accurate data annotation and validation to take place. Moving forward, our focus is on further developing our tech as we expand our presence in industries such as retail, biotechnology, and media communications.\n\nWe are excited to share this milestone in our company’s history as we embark on our journey to becoming the world’s leading training data provider. Our new name, in conjunction with our doubled down approach to technology, will guide our company and our mission for years to come.\n\nWithout our community's help, we could not have gotten to where we are today, so thank you to all the Sama employees, investors, and partners for supporting us throughout this transitional journey.\n\nWe can’t wait for you to see what’s next.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"samasource-is-now-sama"},"tags":[{"_key":"GS7wrNs8","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"BSu2iKoe","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"},{"_key":"YLf0JPMd","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"We Are Now Sama: Accurate Data For Ambitious AI"},{"_createdAt":"2020-12-01T19:25:19Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1fd7fbcc4633299cdbedddba22cb44e24f17317-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

She was interviewing me and spoke excitedly about the potential of Sama achieving B Corp certification, one of her main priorities for the company. In the next breath, she talked about dominating the training data industry and catapulting Sama to claim its much-earned spot in the AI landscape.\n\nThis introduction was just the first of many conversations we would later have on the importance of sustainability, impact, and responsible hyper-growth.\n\nI’m deeply humbled and honored to announce that, as of today, Sama is among the first AI companies to receive the prestigious B Corp certification. The achievement comes on the heels of completing our three-year Randomized Control Trial (RCT), which demonstrated the actualized impact of our hybrid model and continued commitment to fusing purpose and profit, both internally and externally.\n\n\n\n“This achievement is the result of years of hard work and dedication from our entire Sama community. By securing B Corp certification and completing our RCT, we’re not only carrying Leila’s passion and commitment to impact, but we’re making a tremendous stride within the AI industry,” says Wendy Gonzalez, CEO of Sama. “I’d like to extend immense thanks to everyone who played a part in making Leila’s dream a reality.”\n\n\n\nB Corp certification is a measurement certified by B Lab, a non-profit company that measures a company’s social and environmental performance. We received a score of 98.5, excelling in the ‘Workers' and 'Community Impact' criteria, and placing us well above the 80 points necessary to achieve B Corporation status. Of the 3,500+ Certified B Corporations, Sama is the first and only AI company recognized and joins companies such as WeTransfer, Patagonia, Hootsuite, and Ben & Jerry’s, all who use business as a force for good.\n\nThree years ago, Leila kicked off what would become a rigorous journey towards completing a full RCT. This in-depth trial, often referred to as the \"gold standard\" in research, evaluated our training and employment effectiveness towards our mission of creating a sustainable pathway out of poverty. It studied three groups of individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds that were randomly assigned to receive either training through Sama (Group 1), training and the opportunity for employment at Sama (Group 2), or neither training nor the opportunity for employment (Control Group).\n\nOne of the trial’s main findings is that individuals who are trained and employed by Sama make higher levels of employment and earnings (Group 2). This study and subsequent completion of the RCT further validated the training programs we’ve created at Sama, an impact model that has helped 50,000 people lift themselves out of poverty, increased wages by 4x, and provided over 11,000 hours of training. \n\nBecoming B Corp certified and completing an RCT in tandem is a direct example of how our team at Sama is leveraging AI to address critical societal issues. This year has proved that making a real impact and having a mission-driven business model is what truly matters in driving the bottom line. We believe that receiving B Corp certification should be the new metric companies strive for in today’s day and age. It’s not just about chasing after unicorn status anymore, it’s about creating a successful company while creating meaningful change. \n\nWe’ve accomplished our goals in large part as a result of our supportive community, but it doesn’t stop here. We’re looking forward to continuing our commitment to making a lasting impact on the world and improving the lives of as many as possible.\n\nDue to our hardworking team and our supportive investors, friends and family, we’ve been able to follow through on the vision and legacy created by our founder, Leila Janah.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Sama team, thanks for taking this journey with us.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"we-are-a-b-corp"},"tags":[{"_key":"hZTYAcKb","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"DDJ2bEmS","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"oKWZS5Lg","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"AuzJCOHb","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"From Dreams to Reality: Our Journey to Becoming a Certified B Corporation"},{"_createdAt":"2020-06-19T20:12:52Z","author":{"_id":"a009d418-aa96-47ac-a73a-fd2cd52c79d9","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0d717f753ba4876a6b0dbf9f125cf6c3d27e545-500x500-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Wendy Gonzalez is an executive passionate about building high-performing, high-functioning teams that develop and scale innovative, impactful technology.

This systemic challenge we face requires not only immediate action. It requires a change in the way we think, see, and operate.\n\nTrue change happens with purposeful action and in the decisions we make every day. It takes investment for the long term, even when there is pressure to perform in the short term. As I’ve been telling my teams as we organize to contribute the fight for justice for Black people, “We are in a marathon, not a sprint.”\n\nI also firmly believe that change starts locally. It starts with us as individuals and within our communities.\n\nLastly, change needs to be measurable - not just this quarter or next, but on an ongoing basis. We need to hold ourselves accountable to ensure we’re making positive progress toward a more just, equitable society. Since our founding in 2008, we have treated our impact metrics with the same level of fidelity and reporting as we have our financials. We will apply the same rigor of measure to the Black Lives Matter engagement strategy and actions I’m committing to today.\n\nFollowing our company values, we’ve decided to take action both inside our organization and in partnership with local organizations to drive toward a more equitable society where Black people in America realize the same level of humanity as others.\n\nI’m committing to four core initiatives to support racial inclusion.\n\nFinancial Support: Earlier this week, we launched a corporate matching program to raise donations for three local organizations. Sama seeded this program with funds and is matching each employee donation 2:1. The three local organizations include:\n\nCode2040, a San Francisco based nonprofit activating, connecting, and mobilizing the largest racial equity community in tech to dismantle the structural barriers that prevent Black and Latinx technologists from fully participating in the tech industry.\n\nAI4ALL, an Oakland based non-profit lead by a Sama alum, opens doors to artificial intelligence for underrepresented talent through education and mentorship.\n\nColor Of Change, an Oakland based organization, is the nation’s largest online justice organization. They design campaigns powerful enough to end practices that hold Black people back, and champion solutions that move us all forward.\n\nHoodstock, a Montreal based organization, generates spaces for dialogue and mobilizing initiatives to eliminate systemic inequalities and develop supportive, inclusive, secure and dynamic communities.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: While we have rigorous programs in place to address gender diversity and inclusion, and enjoy a cross-cultural mix of people within our organization, we found that our North American diversity representation could be improved. To achieve this goal, we’re committing to expand our gender diversity and inclusion program to specifically include inclusion metrics for Black and other people of color.\n\nInternal Education: We are committed to hosting internal education and engagement sessions covering topics such as institutional racism, racial bias in AI, diversity hiring best practices, and the importance of voting. We also started an internal forum for our teams to openly exchange ideas for action and provide additional support to each other.\n\nPartnerships: We are engaging with partners within the AI community committed to better understanding and taking action against AI Bias. We’re also engaging with organizations that support upskilling, mentoring, and recruitment to drive economic mobility and inclusion for Black Americans in the tech industry.\n\nMy hope is that everyone in our broader technology community will drive the change needed to make the United States a more equitable and inclusive country. We must stand together and bring humanity to our industry, and to our country.\n\n(In case you missed it, below is our original statement. )\n\nThe murder of George Floyd has reignited an international movement for equality and justice. It sparked a powder keg of emotions that have left many feeling frustrated, helpless, angry, outraged, and sad. We here at Sama stand by one of our core company values -- Humanity. Humanity for the countless number of Black lives who have been victims of police brutality. Humanity for every person that tries to survive daily in a system that routinely oppresses them. Humanity for those who so often do not receive it, all because of the color of their skin.\n\nThe world of tech so often speaks of creating a new, better world -- but we cannot do that if we do not stand for the rights of everyone. Humanity and compassion are necessary. In order to avoid bias in ourselves and the technology we produce, we must consider how daily actions, words, and thoughts contribute to a racist and prejudiced world.\n\nTo quote our late founder Leila Janah, “Don’t underestimate the ripple effect of what you do. These kinds of small actions undertaken in coordination by large numbers of people have toppled empires.” We stand in solidarity with those driving positive change. Here is a list of resources we found helpful.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"our-commitment-to-racial-justice-and-equality"},"tags":[{"_key":"ceQUdDQq","label":"Company News","value":"Company News"},{"_key":"Ac6EgzO1","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"s1l8UVKZ","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Underscoring Our Commitment to Racial Justice and Equality"},{"_createdAt":"2020-04-22T23:33:05Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

In addition to spearheading our impact model, she sparked a deep love of nature in the visitors to our East African offices by increasing their exposure to African nature and wildlife. One of her favorite topics to muse about over the past few years was how to calculate the positive climate impacts of hiring and empowering women in East Africa.\n\nOn this 50th anniversary of Earth Day, I want to take the time to remember Leila’s legacy by giving you a glimpse into a few of the sustainability activities we are working on here at Sama. Mid last year, we officially launched our sustainability program. Our first goals were to understand our carbon footprint (GHGe per GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, Scope 1 and 2), develop an environmentally preferable purchasing program for ongoing consumables, and create biophilic office environments that brought nature inside.\n\nPHOTO: Sama East Africa delivery center\n\n\n\nUltimately, Leila wanted to pursue B Corporation certification. She always wanted to lead by example, to show the world how business could be both profitable and a force for good.\n\nWhat better way to do this than provide the ultimate success story and demonstrate that a technology company can be committed to both providing the leading training data platform and to using business as a force for good?\n\n“One of the things I’m proudest of at Sama is our collaboration with conservation groups including the Nature Conservancy to use AI to track endangered species, combat poaching, and protect wilderness. Not only that, but we do it by employing women (more than 50% of our workforce!) from low-income backgrounds, which itself is a way to fight climate change.” - Leila Janah\n\n\n\nI’m thrilled that Sama is actively engaged with B Lab and is in the final stages of audit verification for our B Corporation certification. I couldn’t be prouder of our Nairobi based Sustainability Analyst, Robert Wahome, for ensuring we have all of the data in place needed to drive this initiative forward, including our first ever Carbon Footprint. In my heart, I know Leila is proud too.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"celebrating-50-years-of-earth-day-honoring-leila-janahs-legacy"},"tags":[{"_key":"OFjdWc6T","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"OtSjlWNo","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"fWAUAQ8u","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Celebrating 50 Years of Earth Day: Honoring Leila Janah's Legacy"},{"_createdAt":"2019-07-01T21:45:00Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

While our headquarters is in San Francisco, we’re one of the largest AI providers, and one of the largest digital employers, in East Africa.\n\nBefore joining Sama, I knew AI had a human element - that the algorithms we train couldn’t exist without humans.\n\nAfter all, every marketing slick touts how the combination of human and machine intelligence will make us smarter, more efficient -- superhuman.\n\nWhat we’re not told is that behind every machine learning algorithm, there’s a band of people tasked with labeling the data used to train AI technologies.\n\nFor example, a self-driving car gets its initial smarts from a human reviewing thousands of images and/or video and labeling the cars, trucks, sidewalks, pedestrians, etc., that are present. This is how the car learns to be autonomous.\n\nThese humans creating training data for algorithms are the soul of AI.\n\nEarlier in my career, I had a deep focus in measuring and managing environmental and social impacts of supply chains and implementing corporate impact programs. Carbon footprint and circular economy were part of my everyday lexicon.\n\nNow, staring into the eyes of our human workforce -- the real-life AI supply chain -- I started to think of the implications for supply chain ethics and sustainability. And, I realized how serendipitous it was to be working at an organization that embraced paying a living wage and equally distributing opportunity from the start, thanks to the vision of our founder Leila Janah.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-ai-supply-chain-protecting-the-soul-of-ai"},"tags":[{"_key":"5qTQ6zwl","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"iRBewe3m","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"29LDhGI9","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"TkUkSBfs","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"The Ethical AI Supply Chain: Protecting the Soul of AI"},{"_createdAt":"2016-01-26T21:48:00Z","author":{"_id":"037257b7-27fe-47e4-8b0b-7fc05f55fa6d","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-d3fb21c2ca35139da39b453c1981b5d04545ab51-800x800-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":null,"name":"Leila Janah","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"leila-janah"}},"config":{"description":"Davos: It's Not Enough to do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)","openGraphImage":null,"title":"Davos: It's Not Enough to Do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)"},"estimatedReadingTime":6,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-37701649c15c883643f12a6b0a10ebb11dfdd4c3-5472x3648-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"plaintextBody":"I spent last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos raising funds for Sama and building Laxmi’s global community of retailers and partners. Along the way I came across some especially powerful ideas, and reinforced one of our own (the impact bond).\n\nHere are five key tech and social impact trends from this year’s Forum:\n\n1. It’s not enough to do less bad. We say this a lot in the office — new businesses can’t define themselves by avoiding the bad (not polluting, not hiring slaves, not using toxic ingredients). The best emerging companies, and the savviest traditional/old brands, understand that creating positive social and environmental impact in the world is important to Millennial consumers. Corporate social responsibility is dead — it feels too weak. We want to see corporate activism on issues like climate change, human rights, and equal pay. It’s already happening. Richard Branson’s B Team hosted a lunch on this and entertained several ideas put forth by social entrepreneurs (including my friends Jeremy Heimans and Nancy Lublin). Chanel’s chief legal counsel said during a brilliant sustainable fashion session organized by Zara Ingilizian that in an era of rising inequality, “the only way luxury can exist is through total integrity.”\n\n\n\n2. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is the way leaders will talk about tech. Professor Klaus Schwab, WEF’s Founder, wrote a new book and named the conference after this theme. The Fourth Industrial revolution refers to digital integration across every industry, from agriculture (think smart crop monitoring via drones) to mindfulness (Paul Davidson’s Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction program is now online) and non-profit work (Nancy Lublin’s Crisis Text Line is a great example). Schwab’s idea is that technology is a revolution as profound as the Enlightenment — what came before will not predict what comes afterwards. There are pros and cons to this shift — we will see rising global prosperity and access to basic goods and services, but we’ll also see economic shocks as more jobs are automated.\n\n\n\n3. Impact bonds and pay-for-outcomes models will dominate global social sector funding. It’s crazy that we spend billions on global development programs that may or may not lead to outcomes — instead, agencies fund programs and activities. We need a new way to fund the most important social sector work that gives organizations the freedom to innovate and spend as they see fit, so long as they deliver. The social impact bond has been tried in dozens of settings — to reduce recidivism, for example, in the UK and the US. How it works: non-profits with demonstrated outcomes commit to a certain target for a given sum — for example, 2,500 people moved out of poverty for $2.5M dollars over three years. Private investors put up the capital (a “security”) via an intermediary. If the non-profit hits the target, philanthropists pay back the investors with a return (usually 4–5%). Donors don’t pay unless the outcome is achieved, investors bear the risk, and non-profits have access to unrestricted capital. Sama is raising growth capital though an impact security — learn more here.\n\n\n\n4. “Stakeholder capitalism” is no longer niche; it’s mainstream. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff described Schwab’s early idea that stakeholders matter more than simply shareholders as formative. Salesforce’s 1–1–1 model (1% donation of product, profit, and employee volunteer time) was directly inspired by this thinking, as is much of the benefit corporation movement. “Stakeholder capitalism” shifts the focus of business from the narrow lens of short-term shareholder profit to a broad definition of profit that includes workers, customers, and the environment — a very important factor in how Millennials work, shop, and spend time. I think in time we will expand this idea to include “giving work” rather than donating capital — addressing poverty, recidivism, and a host of other social problems by incentivizing companies to hire from marginalized populations.\n\n\n\n5. Safe harbor provisions would allow tech platforms to innovate around labor. What does a job mean today, when 40% of US workers are “contingent labor” (read: contract workers)? 50% of Uber drivers work fewer than 10 hours a week. And what about Airbnb? The founders of these companies aren’t evil — they’re probably much more socially progressive than their Wall Street counterparts. So why not allow them to test things like contributions to retirement plans, better training, and the like without forcing these companies to risk massive lawsuits for being considered employers of record? This issue came up in discussions with US Senator Mark Warner and the Markle Initiative’s Zoe Baird, who are keen to propose legislation along these lines.\n\n\nMy personal favorite moment: running into Dr. Muhammad Yunus three times — twice in the cloakroom — and talking to him about #GiveWork, the core idea behind Sama. Yunus is a legend in the Sama office for his decades-long struggle to build microfinance into a movement (and the subject of my favorite Halloween costume). I had to pinch myself.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"davos-its-not-enough-to-do-less-bad-5-tech-and-impact-trends"},"tags":[{"_key":"XcKmjphM","label":"Ethical AI","value":"Ethical AI"},{"_key":"1tC6Pi0u","label":"Impact","value":"Impact"},{"_key":"X3YfCf7h","label":"Leila Janah","value":"Leila Janah"}],"title":"Davos: It's Not Enough to Do Less Bad (5 Tech and Impact Trends)"}],"morePosts":[],"slug":"leila-janah","tagName":"Leila Janah","pageConfig":{"title":"Sama Blog | Training Data, AI and Impact Sourcing Insights","description":"From machine learning to training data strategy, the Sama blog covers research, news and other AI trends from thought leaders across the globe."}}},"__N_SSG":true}
