Unfortunately, many decision-makers still underestimate the time and resources needed to create, manage, and annotate datasets. Indeed, creating quality datasets is often one of the most expensive and time-consuming elements of building a machine learning application.\n\nBut how do you define data quality and measure it? Furthermore, how do you improve it? The answers depend on the type of problem you’re solving.\n\n\nDefining Training Data Quality in Annotation\n\nIn data annotation, we often speak of “accuracy” and “consistency”. Accuracy in data labeling measures how close the labeling is to ground-truth or how well the labeled features in the data are matching real-world conditions. Consistency refers to the degree of accuracy across the overall dataset. Are annotations consistently accurate across your datasets? Other characteristics of data quality may include completeness, integrity, reasonability, timeliness, uniqueness, validity, and accessibility.\n\nThe path to high-quality, scalable data quality always begins with a deep understanding of your project requirements, allowing you to develop well-defined annotation criteria against which to measure quality. Experienced AI-driven organizations often establish a quality rubric that describes what quality means in the context of a project. Sama’s approach is to anticipate the errors that we might see in a task and assign numerical penalty values before the annotation process starts.\n\nThe main benefit of this approach is to ensure that both your company and Sama’s team are on the same page about how quality is defined and measured. This allows our experts to create comprehensive and actionable instructions without room for interpretation and inconsistencies, saving a lot of time down the road.\n\nMeasuring Training Data Quality\n\nSeveral methods exist to help companies measure data quality. To define the correct annotation of given data, you want to start by creating annotation guidelines. On top of proposing a multi-level quality checks system, Sama’s experts have built unique know-how in efficiently designing annotation guidelines that enhance data quality.\n\nHere are some of the more common data quality measurement processes:\n\n\n1. Benchmarks or gold sets help measure how well a set of annotations from a group or individual matches the vetted benchmark established by knowledge experts or data scientists. Benchmarks tend to be the most affordable QA option since it involves the least amount of overlapping work. Benchmarks can provide a useful reference point as you continue to measure your output's quality during the project. They can also be used as test datasets to screen annotation candidates.\n\nAt Sama, Gold Tasks are used in two more ways: During training, to assess annotators and identify those ready to move into production, and once in production to generate an automated metric on quality. You can read more about Sama’s approach to gold tasks here.\n\n2. Consensus measures the percentage of agreement between multiple human or machine annotators. To calculate a consensus score, it is necessary to divide the sum of agreeing labels by the total number of labels per asset. The goal is to arrive at a consensus decision for each item. An auditor typically arbitrates any disagreement amongst the overlapped judgments. Consensus can be either performed by assigning a certain number of reviewers per data point or be automated.\n\n3. Cronbach's alpha test is an algorithm used to measure the average correlation or consistency of items in a dataset. Depending on the characteristics of research (for instance, its homogeneity), it may help quickly assess the labels’ overall reliability.\n\n4. Review is another method to measure data quality. This method is based on the review of label accuracy by a domain expert. The review is usually conducted by visually checking a limited number of labels, but some projects review all labels. Sama enables companies to easily review quality through a sampling portal: a dedicated portal providing full transparency and accountability on data quality. Your team can get full transparency on the batch’s quality and provide direct feedback to data trainers.\n\nDue to the iterative machine learning model testing and validation stages, we must keep in mind that data quality can change during a project. As you train your model or after making your solution live, you’ll probably find patterns in your inaccuracies or identify edge cases that will force you to adapt your dataset.\n\nReviewing Training Data Quality\n\nBecause no two AI projects are alike, you need to make sure that your quality assurance (QA) process is designed to meet the unique needs of your particular project. Here, both data accuracy and consistency are reviewed, separate steps that a data scientist or project manager may perform manually or in an automated way.\n\nTwo different types of QA processes:\n\nSama’s own QA managers review the tasks using both manual and automated techniques.\n\nClient’s QA process performed by a data scientist, most likely manual only.\n\nReviewing tasks is a pain point for most data science teams. We believe that your team should spend less time on these time-consuming and tedious tasks and spend more time on strategic work. As such, we created the Auto QA process. Auto QA creates an instant feedback loop to prevent logical fallacies, which helps annotators improve and get it right the first time.\n\nAutomated logic checks are triggered before a task is submitted on Sama’s platform by our annotators. Auto logic checks can identify several potential issues in your data— for instance, invalid answer combinations, repetitions, or size requirements. Leveraging Auto QA will help you prevent errors that may be impossible to detect by the manual QA review process. It reduces the time spent by manual QAs and allows annotators to focus on the more critical errors or edge cases.\n\nSama’s training data platform handles the entire annotation lifecycle and employs a quality feedback loop, enabling us to offer the highest quality SLA (>95%), even on the most complex workflows. Understanding the importance and prioritizing the quality of your training data will help in achieving success with your models. The first step in gaining good quality training data begins with finding the right processes and platforms to label your training data.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"define-and-measure-training-data-quality"},"tags":[{"_key":"aZTVAo0T","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"Wr7YIM1K","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"How to Define and Measure Your Training Data Quality"},{"_createdAt":"2021-03-23T19:00:21Z","author":{"_id":"4e2e7cef-d6eb-4bb7-bd39-375c6299677e","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-f1a274bcfdb5e70d814f1bab2b6bbd644728e9be-1480x1462-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"With a background in Computer Science, Abha leads the Customer Success Engineering team at Sama.

To define the correct annotation of given data, you want to start by creating annotation guidelines. On top of proposing a multi-level quality checks system, Sama’s experts have built unique know-how in efficiently designing annotation guidelines that enhance data quality.\n\nCue Gold Tasks; referring to tasks that have been annotated “perfectly” or meet the “gold standard”. Such tasks are often used by the client to communicate their expectations around precision and quality used as examples during training. At Sama, we use Gold Tasks in two more ways: During training, to assess annotators and identify those who are ready to move into production and during production to generate an automated metric on quality.\n\nGold Assessments\n\nEvery project launch at Sama is accompanied with a period of training, where annotators focus on requirements for the specific workflow, familiarizing themselves with the taxonomy, accuracy levels needed, and edge cases. Gold tasks come in as they move from classroom training to practice tasks.\n\nA gold set is created that is representative of the overall complexity of the dataset, ensuring a healthy mix of the edge cases. annotators practice on this set of which we already have “gold” answers. As each task is submitted we are able to compare the annotator answers with the gold task, generating custom metrics and error tags. The metrics are determined by the type of workflow and tool used, for e.g. in a semantic segmentation workflow, we focus on IoU calculations per label and depending on the client rubric each label may be weighed differently.\n\nThese metrics are then used to create trends and analyze each annotator’s performance individually, and provide relevant feedback. We are able to analyze trends at an asset label (which type of images are more difficult than others?), annotator level (which annotator is struggling exactly where?), and the impact of time (was today better than yesterday?).\n\nGold assessments, therefore, help us accelerate training by providing customized feedback to each annotator early on and allowing us to track their improvement over time. This enables Sama to quickly identify doubts, find edge cases, and have high confidence that annotators are ready to move on to production. Lastly, this allows us to calibrate and train the manual QAs on the specifics of this particular workflow, ensuring that nothing is missed.\n\n\nGold Metrics\n\nSimilar to gold assessments, gold metrics compare an annotator’s tasks against a known, completed task. These tasks, however, are interspersed within the production queue with the annotators unaware that these are gold tasks. These tasks then act as tests for the annotators, generating similar metrics as mentioned above. This allows the team to report upon the annotator’s performance against the gold tasks that increase insight into quality and help to further tailor training and coaching.\n\nGold metrics are most useful for clients looking to automate the quality loop on their side. Given that their Sama project team consistently samples and approves only high quality tasks, it is a neat way for them to save time and capacity.\n\nBecause no two AI projects are alike, you need to make sure that your quality assurance (QA) process is designed to meet the unique needs of your particular project.

What are automated quality accelerators and why should we care? Automated quality accelerators are technology innovations that are focused on reducing the amount of manual quality assurance time spent in QA processes. They may be used to expedite annotator education, generate automated measures of annotation quality, and prevent logical fallacies. Our accelerators are integrated into our Sama training data platform and can be customized for unique use cases and needs by our dedicated Customer Success Engineering team.\n\nWhile it’s key to have a human in the loop when creating and verifying training data, automating processes within the workflow improves efficiency while guaranteeing high quality, saving everyone time and money. Quality accelerators also focus the effort of Sama’s annotators towards the most challenging aspect of the task, minimizing the volume of manual rework they need to do, and catching mistakes early in the process —equipping them to do their job well. Ultimately, automated quality accelerators enable us to deliver super high-quality data for complex use cases in the most efficient manner.\n\n\n\nAutomated Quality Accelerators at Sama\n\nAutomated Logic Checks:\n\n\n\nAutomated Logic checks are triggered before a task is submitted on Sama by our annotators. Each task is assessed using a fixed set of rules to check for invalid combinations of labels within a shape, across all shapes, and dependencies with the metadata. These rules are flexible and customized to each workflow, focusing on all errors types that don’t need human judgement. If an error is found, the annotator needs to fix the task before it can be submitted. To help the annotator to fix the task and learn from their mistake, a message is displayed which contains shape specific error tags.\n\nAuto logic checks are optimized for different kinds of errors, including but not limited to:\n\nInvalid answer combinations: Combinations that the ontology prevents, for example more than two wheels being tagged on an item labeled “bicycle.”\n\nUniqueness or preventing repetitions: More than one object in an image being assigned the same unique identifier or the same label when the ontology prohibits that. For example, two noses in a single person keypoints workflow.\n\nSize requirements: Ensuring that size specifications are met. For example, guaranteeing consistent size in a 3D workflow where constant cuboid size is required or enforcing a minimum pixel rule\n\nRelational checks: Given attributes and sub-attributes, ensure that values selected aren’t contradictory. For example, a bicyclist polygon isn’t grouped/attached to a car bounding box\n\nThese checks are incredibly efficient for the following reasons:\n\nCreate an instant feedback loop to prevent logical fallacies, which helps annotators improve and get it right the first time\n\nPrevents errors that may be impossible to detect by a manual QA review processes\n\nReduces time spent by manual QAs and allow them to focus on the more critical errors or sample more tasks\n\nHelps annotators to adapt quickly to changing project instructions, ensuring that new instructions are being followed and are understood correctly\n\nLastly, it improves overall TPT and reduces the time from task creation to delivery\n\nUnder a strictly manual process, highly skilled quality assurance annotators would need to review and provide feedback manually. While the latter process is still a vital part of our human-in-the-loop data annotation, auto logic checks free up their expertise to focus on more subjective errors and edge cases.\n\nOur enterprise-level clients are successfully using Sama Quality Accelerators to realize extremely high data quality for their most complex use cases, improving overall model performance.

It is widely accepted that without ample amounts of high-quality training data, the application of AI and Machine Learning is impossible. This has also been seen in studies, including an IDC survey, in which only 30% of companies reported a 90% or higher success rate in their AI rollout, with reported failure rates of 10 to 49 percent. A key reason for this? Data! \n\nWe partnered with our friends from RE•WORK to reach out to various ML experts, specifically asking them the questions: Why is high-quality training data so important? Why do so many projects fail in ML?\n\n\nManmeet Singh\nMachine Learning Lead, Apple\n\n\"The core of any Machine Learning model is what input is being fed to it as the model generalizes based on these training examples. The criteria to choose a ML model is heavily dependent on the kind of input available. For the model to learn anything relevant, training data plays a key role. Imagine in a supervised setting, we are trying to do object recognition. If the labels themselves are messed up what would the model learn? Besides the quality, the quantity of training examples also plays a major role. Training data forms the basis of business decisions based on the offline KPIs being measured on their information. They are the building block for defining a roadmap to the product cycle.\"\n\n\nIndu Khatri\nMachine Learning Lead, HSBC\n\n\"There are two main reasons why quality training data is important. First one is that many problems are solved using Supervised Learning and training data forms the backbone for such applications. The second and more deeper reason is that with the advent of AutoML, democratization of ML skills, and open sourcing of cutting edge research and tools; they are no longer competitive advantages. The only way businesses can sustain a competitive advantage in AI applications is through differentiated training data.\"\n\n\nLavi Nigam\nData Scientist, Gartner\n\n\"In supervised learning, algorithms are dependent on training data to extract relevant patterns for future predictability, hence clean, unbiased and processed training data is crucially important. It’s like the “garbage in garbage out” rule for training any ML/DL models. Although, sometimes, we have lack of training data available and in such cases we have many new semi-supervised learning algorithms coming up. I see great future in such techniques as businesses all across the world don't work at Google/Facebook data scales mostly.\"\n\n\nZhiyong (Sean) Xie\nDirector, AI, Pfizer\n\n“‘Give me a lever long enough, and I shall move the world’. With deep learning methods, we may say ‘Give me data big enough and I can predict anything.’ Data is the foundation of Machine Learning, especially the deep learning method, with the machines learning everything from data. If you feed a machine biased data, it gives you biased predictions. Garbage in, garbage out.”\n\n\nShuo Zhang\nSenior ML Engineer, Bose Corporation\n\n“One point I'd like to stress is the domain knowledge and domain specificity in ML. People sometimes think of ML as a ubiquitous technology that can be universally applied to any domain. But in reality, blindly applying ML is dangerous, and you should always know your domain and your data in a very deep way.”\n\n\nPiero Molino\nNLP Research Scientist, Staff ML Team, Stanford\n\n\"How would you train models without it? More seriously, quality and size of data are important because we are trying to tackle difficult tasks and we haven't figured out yet methods that are very robust to noise or that can be trained from smaller amounts of data.\"\n\n\nSparkle R. \nAssociate Director Data Science, Johnson & Johnson\n\n\"While innovative ML tools and techniques are being developed at a rapid pace, ML practitioners can sometimes get drawn into the novelty of applying newer approaches without realizing that the fundamentals of science and lack of high-quality data make many of these algorithms impractical for some healthcare facing solutions. Additionally, in our haste to publish our findings, researchers often forget that these systems will be used by an end-user (patient and provider), and expert level performance in development does not guarantee real-world clinical utility, adoption and transferability across heterogeneous healthcare systems. So, it is equally important that the end user’s workflow is also considered to ensure that the lab to real world transition is successful.\"\n\n\nYaman Kumar\nPhD Computer Science, University of Buffalo\n\n\"Training data is so important since most of the people, books, blogs, videos start and end with supervised learning. We currently do not know how to work in unsupervised settings. As we move towards unsupervised settings, the requirement of training data as we know it will reduce. In that world, gathering training data would not be an arduous task as it is supposed to be now.\"\n\n\nKiana Alikhademi\nArtificial Intelligence & Computer Science, University of Florida\n\n\"Training data is the backbone of any machine learning system, without sufficient training data, it is impossible for a machine to learn patterns or solve problems. The importance of training data illustrates why inadequate, or low quality training data, could lead to Machine Learning systems’ failure. Training data ought to be representative of all different groups within the sample without inheriting any societal prejudices.\"\n\n\nJack Brzezinski\nChief AI Scientist at AI Systems & Strategy Lab\n\n\"I feel that the role of knowledge will be increasing. Structures, various knowledge representation types will be essential for the next wave of AI innovation. The lawmakers might soon require AI, ML models to be compliant with multiple statutes or regulations.\"","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"experts-high-quality-training-data-importance"},"tags":[{"_key":"HWRhI8n2","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"QPqXb7Bo","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"deOuCKuN","label":"Expert Advice","value":"Expert Advice"}],"title":"10 Experts Give Reasons Why High-Quality Training Data is so Important"},{"_createdAt":"2021-01-19T17:04:40Z","author":{"_id":"7aaa2439-b7e5-45f9-8aee-1fbf3c9b5fb8","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-0a1ace27b14b286beed42f8a189b8d4c9f8d5e71-512x512-webp","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Dimitri is a software developer specializing in computer vision.

It's therefore usually not performed locally. One of the challenges when it comes to launching training jobs on the cloud or private GPU clusters is dealing with all the required manual steps. For example, when using AWS, ML engineers need to spin-up an EC2 instance manually to launch a training job, and then manually decommission it once the training job is completed. \n\nAlthough commercial tools do exist to automate this process (for example, SageMaker or DataBricks), at Sama we decided to build our own automated training pipeline in order to limit costs, and to avoid tying ourselves to a particular cloud provider.\n\nOur pipeline allows our ML Engineers and Scientists to launch a training job on the cloud by simply pushing the code they developed locally to a predefined git branch. This is very simple to achieve using a modern CI/CD platform like Codefresh. A Codefresh “trigger” can be set to track commits to specific git branches of a repository. Once a commit is pushed to a target branch, a Codefresh pipeline is triggered. The pipeline is just a workflow defined in a yaml file that executes the following steps :\n\nClone the tracked git repository, as well as any other repos required (in our case we have a separate repo for all our ML related tools).\n\nBuild a Docker image with all the project specific dependencies.\n\nDeploy the training job on the GPU cluster.\n\nSend a slack message to a channel that tracks all the training jobs whenever the results are ready or if there is an error.\n\nThe specific implementation of step 3 above depends on the particular frameworks and libraries that are used to train the models and track their performance, as well as the cloud provider. In our team, we use Kubernetes to orchestrate the creation and decommission of the instances. We also use mlflow to manage the ML lifecycle, which has built-in Kubernetes deployment support. So for us, this step simply reduces to doing some cloud provider specific configuration and running an mlflow experiment with Kubernetes as the backend.\n\n\n\nSummary of the Sama automated training pipeline: from pushing the code to Github to running the training job on AWS.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious time savings, the advantage of this setup is that it is fully configurable and can be made to work with any cloud provider, or even a private GPU cluster. As an added bonus, it enforces experiments to be separated in different git commits, which we find is good practice.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"part-1-automating-model-training-on-the-cloud"},"tags":[{"_key":"OdrqBpR4","label":"Sama Engineering","value":"Sama Engineering"},{"_key":"Yw0P8Jjj","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"08tVZdgm","label":"MLOps","value":"MLOps"},{"_key":"eMmu9s8R","label":"Featured","value":"Featured"}],"title":"The Sama MLOps Pipeline: Automating Model Training on the Cloud"},{"_createdAt":"2020-06-10T16:27:24Z","author":{"_id":"80db3356-b402-44cb-a717-2e0f9c9fa3e4","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-399295e959574e371fe2ba7bfd55ba4aee8a589d-320x320-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Heather is passionate about bringing world-changing technologies to market and using supply chain purchasing power for good.

While the initial public perception of AI was “will automation steal my job”, steady progress has seen facets of AI and Machine Learning technology present in our living rooms, cars, phones and more, mostly without people knowing. That said, an important question has emerged: What level of trust can—and should—we place in these AI systems?\n\nIn an age of increasingly complex governmental data privacy requirements, it can be hard to understand not only the level of personal data that’s available, but also how this is protected, both in law (GDPR, Information Privacy law etc.), but also through the development of solution provider products.\n\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) is to be considered any information which could identify a specific individual. Of course, the wide definition of PII can create challenges, especially when searching for AI training data as it can cover anything from IP addresses, imagery, behavioral data, social media information, and more.\n\nWhy do we need such swathes of data? Well, a simple input/output equation suggests that more data equates to the ability for increased training and training environments. This, in turn, leads to models that are often increasingly accurate due to both the level of training and the various training scenarios it has been placed inside [1]. At this stage, it is also important to recognize the differentiation between both structured & unstructured data as well as supervised & unsupervised learning. You can read more on this here.\n\nTo surmise, the main challenges faced by those in need of large data training sets include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nInability to utilize all owned data due to GDPR and CCPA privacy restrictions\n\nLack of anonymized video training data available for use\n\nPreviously used techniques, including pixelation of imagery reducing model performance for video analysis\n\nRequired manual human intervention\n\nRecent developments on our platform aim to address the above through the use of Vector Annotation, Semantic Segmentation, Lidar/3D Annotation, and Dynamic Labelling. These developments when coupled with ISO-certified data centers, vulnerability testing of systems, data storage encryption & GDPR compliance, not only ensure the highest level of internal security, but also the most dynamic and innovative data utilization service available.\n\nMany applications have previously struggled to keep personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources, especially when street-level images, cars, retail places, and similar are discussed, however, Sama uses deep learning pre-annotation technology to anonymize data without the need for a human intervention! The process for this includes:\n\nData is run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs\n\nThis service automatically detects faces and license plates to obscure and does so until unrecognizable\n\nThis AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm\n\nThe above, through the lack of human intervention further accentuates the privacy of PII data\n\nThis service then allows for increased test data at a faster pace, without compromising security, allowing you to scale your AI whilst also not compromising the trust of stakeholders\n\nWant to learn more?

And unlike human-driven cars, AVs rely solely on their computer vision system and the data used to train them to navigate the world around us.\n\nCurrently, the best self-driving assistance systems incorrectly perceive something in their environment once every tens of thousands of hours. If that object is a traffic light, and the car gets it wrong, passengers, pedestrians, cyclists, etc., are all at risk. Here’s a look at the traffic light problem for autonomous cars from three perspectives. \n\n\n\n1. Traffic lights tell road users when to stop and go, but they only work when everyone follows the rules.\n\nTraffic lights are an engineered system, timed around traffic patterns. There are rules in place that tell cars when to stop and go, but the inherent human behavior of drivers, pedestrians and cyclists sometimes means these rules are loosely interpreted.\n\nThere are no physical barriers forcing road users to abide by traffic signals. They work because drivers follow the rules. AVs must also get the rules right, and that means countless hours of real-world exposure to the unspoken rules (or lack thereof) of the road.\n\nThe quality and accuracy of the data received from sensor packages must be precise, leaving no room for interpretation or inconsistencies. Also, license plates, faces or other personal identifying information (PII) may need to be anonymized to protect the privacy of people who might appear in the raw footage. \n\nEnsuring AVs learn the right rules requires unbiased, appropriately labeled and high-quality training data based on a range of driving scenarios.\n\n\n\n2. Traffic lights challenge both the vision system and the team developing the algorithms.\n\nBecause traffic lights are not a distance detection problem, AVs cannot use lidar or radar to navigate traffic signals. They must rely solely on their computer vision system to understand when to stop and go.\n\nThis can be difficult for both the vision system as well as the team developing the algorithm because the visibility of traffic lights may vary based on weather conditions like bright sunlight, rain, snow or fog. Similarly, not all intersections have traffic lights, so if the AV doesn’t detect one, that could be correct.\n\nThe treatment of out of service traffic signals can also vary. One city might use a plastic bag to indicate an out-of-service light while another city, or even county, might use masking tape or some other method to cover broken traffic signals.\n\nContext clues like head nods or hand signals help human drivers manage low visibility or the lack of a traffic light, but since AVs cannot register this supplemental visual information, machine learning and computer vision engineers must train the AV on such scenarios as they arise.\n\n3. Stock datasets aren’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely.\n\nThe volume and diversity of data required for autonomous vehicles is vast, and stock datasets cannot cover all use cases.\n\nDuncan Curtis, Sama VP of Product shares approximately 1,000 to 10,000 images are needed to deploy a solution onto a vehicle, and in order to launch a product publicly, approximately 10,000 to 100,000 images are needed per ADAS feature. That’s a lot of data, and the amount of data needed to account for edge cases like traffic lights in unique road conditions is unknown.\n\nSince AVs often need data from a specific camera or sensor package (because that’s what the car will use in production), generic stock data isn’t enough to help AVs navigate traffic lights safely. In addition to this, models need to be refreshed with ongoing training data as road rules, and the world around us changes.\n\nOur team of data labeling experts annotate over 4M tasks per month, and for AV use cases, we’ve achieved 99.5 percent quality SLAs with more than 100 tags per image. We’ve also successfully achieved full productivity within our labeling teams in as little as two to five days.\n\nIf you need ground truth data for your ML model, connect with our team for a virtual consultation and demo of our industry-leading data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"the-traffic-light-problem-for-autonomous-vehicles"},"tags":[{"_key":"ivLPY6Ly","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"Liw4Inz5","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"3LVFK315","label":"Data Annotation","value":"Data Annotation"},{"_key":"YhUSiZyI","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"72HsQzsx","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"The Traffic Light Problem for Autonomous Vehicles"},{"_createdAt":"2020-04-02T20:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

And as more organizations develop their own AI and ML programs, the necessity of superior quality data is even more pertinent.\n\nImpact of Biased Data in Computer Vision\n\nAI bias can creep in at any stage of the training data lifecycle, and bias presents itself most commonly in three categories: dataset bias, training bias and algorithmic bias.\n\nDataset bias is as you might expect—the data does not provide enough information for the model to learn the problem, or it’s unrepresentative of reality in some way. Training bias is the result of poor quality or inconsistent data labeling, and lastly, algorithmic bias occurs when the algorithm itself makes poor predictions or produces poor results.\n\nModels trained on biased data not only produce inaccurate algorithms, they also present ethical, legal and safety problems. And in some cases, biased data in computer vision can perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender.\n\nLeft unchecked, algorithms trained on biased data greatly impact the lives of people using the very technologies meant to enhance their everyday experiences.\n\n\n\nCountering Bias in Training Data\n\nCountering bias in training data starts by having an effective training data strategy.\n\nLast year at Embedded Vision Summit, I presented a talk on practical training data strategies to avoid bias, sharing four ways to mitigate unwanted bias in training data. \n\nI want to echo my thoughts here that an effective training data strategy makes for a strong defense against AI bias. Fighting bias in training data means determining your data needs, developing training rules to cover known uses cases, and diversifying data to cover edge cases.\n\nAs your model learns, countering bias means evolving rules and sourcing more data when needed—all while keeping apprised of legal and ethical sourcing considerations.\n\nObtaining Superior Quality Datasets\n\nTop organizations understand that if they want smarter models, they need ethically sourced, quality data (https://www.samasource.com/quality-scale). Your quality requirements might vary, depending on your model, but the fact remains that diverse, high-quality data helps counter AI bias.\n\nFor over a decade, hundreds of organizations, including 25% of the Fortune 50 have relied on Samasource to deliver secure, high-quality training data and model validation for machine learning.\n\nWe’ve helped organizations like Walmart improve their retail item coverage, and others like Vulcan Inc., improve turnaround time to process training datasets. We’ve even partnered with organizations like Cornell Tech to produce an open-source dataset of our own. \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when sourcing superior quality datasets:\n\nBe aware of local privacy and property laws as you collect data.\n\nEnsure you have legal user consent for data capture.\n\nStay informed of the security protocols of facilities processing your training data.\n\nWhen possible, stay informed of the working conditions of the workers labeling your data, and support that pay living wages and benefits.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Samasource securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech, and if your goal is to build smarter AI, contact our team to discuss your training data needs. ","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"fighting-ai-bias-by-obtaining-high-quality-training-data"},"tags":[{"_key":"JOSMV7ei","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"X1b43vej","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"zoYY0bth","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"8v2jDpFA","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"Fighting AI Bias by Obtaining High-Quality Training Data"},{"_createdAt":"2019-09-26T23:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"26fb3cc4-608d-40e1-bb4d-955bceda232a","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"From self-driving cars to smart hardware, Sama fuels AI.

Here are a few things to consider, to strengthen your data security practices.\n\nData Security Best Practices\n\n1. Limit Data Access\n\nLimiting data access based on those who actually need it can help minimize security risks. In addition to things like assigning access based on categories, you can implement infrastructure like a multi-tenant interface to assign roles according to the principle of least privilege.\n\nWe use role based access to ensure client data is only accessed by authorized employees who have a legitimate reason to access the information. For example, data trainers can only perform work, while supervisors can perform work, as well as sampling and QA tasks.\n\n2. Document Your Data Security Policy\n\nA data security policy outlines your organization’s commitment to protect the information you handle, as well as the security measures taken to protect said data.\n\nIf your business operates in or serves residents of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), include details of your data protection responsibilities according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our security and trust webpage features an overview of our data privacy and security policies. You can also download our datasheet to learn more.\n\n\n\n3. Data Encryption In Transit and At Rest\n\nWhen properly encrypted, even compromised data is inaccessible. Our directly managed workforce prepares work in ISO certified delivery centers, using our secure, training data annotation platform. We encrypt client data in transit and at rest, to protect it from unauthorized access from ingestion all the way through to delivery.\n\n4. Conduct Regular Audits\n\nIn addition to limiting data access, encrypting data and following industry-leading data security and privacy practices, consider doing regular audits to help keep your data secure. This could be done on a regular ongoing basis i.e., automated security scanning and pen-testing, in addition to annual or bi-annual checks that take a deeper dive into your infrastructure.\n\n\n\nData privacy and security are fundamental design requirements in our technologies, services, business practices and operations. We use a number of physical and logical security measures, including regular vulnerability testing, to protect client data.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about our annotation platform, download the Solution Brief or request a demo.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"https://www.sama.com/blog/4-things-that-make-a-difference-in-data-security"},"tags":[{"_key":"PJHsWYQd","label":"AI","value":"AI"},{"_key":"n0lW8qhB","label":"Security & Trust","value":"Security & Trust"},{"_key":"hDx5GOGL","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"}],"title":"4 Things That Make a Difference in Data Security"},{"_createdAt":"2019-08-27T16:55:52Z","author":{"_id":"97dc2368-fffb-4c41-82aa-5a9cbe2ec670","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-af58425525bb33d8cffdc1f1b10f02bf1e4faf57-1916x2028-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Sharon is the Content Marketing Manager at Sama where she's responsible for telling the story behind the company's impact sourcing mission and human-powered training data solutions.

Train a Proof-of-Concept ASAP to Determine Data Needs\n\nThe feedback gained from a proof-of-concept (POC) model provides the necessary insight to estimate how much data is needed to achieve level 4 maturity. Don’t wait until you have the “right” amount of data, or an all-encompassing data content scope.\n\nAllow the results of your POC to drive the need for more data and refine, expand and improve as unknown use cases and edge cases surface.\n\n2. Set Clear Training Data Rules to Cover Edge Cases\n\nEdge cases should not be an afterthought, but rather a key component of your training data strategy. Objects may have many different names e.g., Is it a scooter? Or a small moped? Or, perhaps a mini motorbike?\n\nDefine clear classification rules for subjective and specific objects, and set objective rules to determine their class. These training data rules will help you cover edge cases effectively.\n\n3. Choose Your Training Data Partner Wisely\n\nImpact and sustainability have become increasingly more important corporate values. Consider partnering with a training data supplier that utilizes an ethical supply chain like Sama.\n\nOur directly managed workforce has annotated over one million images on Sama, and we’ve helped partners like General Motors and Volkswagen achieve high-quality data at scale with our training data expertise.\n\nBottom line is your actions have impact. Not only will an ethically minded training data strategy lead to higher quality results, you’ll be making a difference in communities near and far.\n\n4. Test Your Model for Bias\n\nIn addition to lower precision, models trained on biased data can have ethical, legal and safety problems. For example, data biased toward pedestrians with lighter skin may cause the model to identify pedestrians with darker skin less accurately. \n\nYou will almost always have overrepresentation of some elements and underrepresentation of others, and thoughtfully testing your model for bias before, after and throughout production will help move your model to maturity.\n\n\n\n5. Continuously Evolve Your Model\n\nModel training is never done. Every day, the world is changing around you. New cars, new fashions, etc., require newly sourced and labeled training data. According to McKinsey Global Institute 1 out of 3 AI systems require model refresh at least monthly and sometimes daily. In cases where your model is weak, treat the occurrence like a bug that needs to be fixed and continuously evolve your model.\n\nAchieving 100% accuracy can feel a lot like approaching the speed of light, and while 100% accuracy isn’t necessary for all algorithms (like chatbots), level 4 maturity is the goal automotive OEMs are striving for.\n\nKirk’s presentation, “Warp “Driving” Approaching AI’s Speed of Light,” urged attendees to be relentless in seeking out weak scenarios to train with new data.\n\nHis key takeaway was training and validation for machine learning may require different precision thresholds and volumes depending on the stage of maturity. If you want to get your AV machine learning model toward 100% accuracy, success will come from being quality-focused and iterative.\n\n","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"https://www.sama.com/blog/moving-toward-level-4-autonomous-driving"},"tags":[{"_key":"3KIYoFV1","label":"Machine Learning","value":"Machine Learning"},{"_key":"bPng3xAl","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"TRiIb7nw","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"},{"_key":"KO7eeuZJ","label":"Autonomous Transportation","value":"Autonomous Transportation"}],"title":"Moving Toward Level 4 Autonomous Driving"},{"_createdAt":"2019-05-20T18:30:00Z","author":{"_id":"6dd25391-26af-42ff-a2a2-f0778ce1b002","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-4e1c47984bb16cb0370855b6272663d6744216d3-450x450-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Product Manager at Sama, Audrey guides cross-functional teams to create thoughtful product solutions.

Audrey Boguchwal, Senior Product Manager at Sama shares four practical approaches to training data strategy that can help AI teams avoid the effects of training data bias. \n\n\n\nThe Impact of Biased Data\n\n\nModels trained on biased data can be less accurate, resulting in insufficient training for your algorithm. Recent studies have shown that biased data can result in problems with facial recognition used in identification, surveillance, and law enforcement. Biased data can also perpetuate historical, negative stereotypes across race and gender. \n\nEnsuring that reality is always represented in your data is a constructive way to minimize the impact of data bias, however, a clear training data strategy to legally and ethically source the data AI requires is fundamental for developing smarter models.\n\n\n\nAvoid Data Bias with a Practical Training Data Strategy\n\nClearly articulate your end training goal and know what data is needed to get to it. When you start with the end goal in mind, you're primed to think through the skill set, tool set and milestones needed to achieve your training goal. For example, for object classifiers, your training data strategy might include preprocessing data to capture bias or offset dataset bias. You recognize that images may look similar before you begin data collection and make a plan to consider transformations i.e. flip or automatically crop images so they vary.\n\nMap out ways bias can enter data and proactively source data to avoid it. Keep in mind that humans are inherently biased, so eliminating all forms of bias is near impossible. Rigorously examine your own biases and the biases of those providing data/information to you.\n\nAvoid selection bias by varying search terms and data sources, and avoid negative set bias by varying data i.e. collect data that contains background scenes in addition to objects of interest. Test before and after training, on a wide range of data. If in the end, you find your model to be of low variance and high bias, use cross-validation to influence the degree of flexibility of your model. Methods like cross dataset generalization can also help determine how reliant your model is on the \"native\" dataset, when compared to other representative datasets.\n\nEnsure data represents reality for your training goal in quantity and diversity, and replenish data often. High-tech, automotive, retail-- there isn't a single industry adopting AI that shows signs of stagnating growth. Refresh data often to stay ahead of trends. Use more than one training set, especially if it's a stock set. Success comes from being iterative, source and label new data as the world changes.\n\nAn effective training data strategy can help you determine ways to mitigate unwanted bias. Audrey Boguchwal, Senior Product Manager at Sama will present \"Practical Approaches to Training Data Strategy: Bias, Legal and Ethical Considerations this year at the 2019 Embedded Vision Summit conference.\n\nAudrey's presentation will expand on the four strategies to avoid training data bias in this post by exploring use-cases that show how unintended bias can creep into datasets, sharing tests to detect dataset bias, and outlining legal and ethical data sourcing considerations.\n\nIf you'll be attending Embedded Vision Summit, stop by booth #621 to discuss your training data needs with the Sama team, or click below to request a demo of our cloud-based data annotation platform.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"4-training-data-strategies-to-avoid-bias"},"tags":[{"_key":"79xbZuT2","label":"Events","value":"Events"},{"_key":"hX284VAD","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"VrBfZ9C5","label":"AI Bias","value":"AI Bias"}],"title":"4 Training Data Strategies to Avoid Bias"},{"_createdAt":"2018-12-14T19:54:00Z","author":{"_id":"71091c91-664a-44a6-9474-acc40eb12457","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-bc776336801adf71e2599337e8d6f02186b109d0-500x500-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Matthew leads the product team at Sama, responsible for the platform that enables Sama's AI/ML data enrichment teams, internal enterprise operations tools to ensure quality and scalability, and all new product initiatives for the evolution of algorithm development and human-powered automation.","name":"Matthew Landry","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"matthew-landry"}},"config":{"description":"Training your AI in 3D","openGraphImage":null,"title":"Training Your AI in 3D"},"estimatedReadingTime":8,"featured_image":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-9a175242c5b6d9d34ab8d001420280c4279ffe11-1125x1500-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"plaintextBody":"The world has three dimensions. Why shouldn't your AI?\n\nToday, we're announcing the production availability of our new 3D annotation engine for the Sama. This new offering allows our expert annotation team to nimbly explore your lidar point clouds, searching for objects of interest and producing the highest quality 3D labels.\n\nAs much as we love a good \"3D\" joke, we can't leave out the important 4th dimension -- time. Building on the object tracking expertise from our video annotation toolkit, we support lengthy sequences of point cloud data, tracking moving objects through time and space.\n\nWAIT, WHAT ARE POINT CLOUDS?\n\nBefore we get too deep into the weeds on 3D annotation, let's take a step back and talk about 3D point clouds and why they are important.\n\nThroughout the history of computer vision technology, two-dimensional camera images have dominated. Techniques to detect edges and extract objects from the background, approaches to estimate relative distances in order to construct implied dimensions, and carefully-calibrated dual-camera captures that triangulate all incrementally nudged forward a machine's ability to \"see.\"\n\nAdvances in deep neural nets dramatically improved computer vision with a greater degree of robustness -- and kicked off the current race to bring self-driving cars to market.\n\nCars are heavy and filled with combustible material. They travel at high velocities. They share the same space as other hurtling vehicles, ambling humans, and wandering animals. This makes the perception of distance absolutely critical. Recognizing an obstruction in the road is step 1; step 2 is estimating distance and making the appropriate response (slam on the brakes? maneuver safely around?).\n\nHence, lidar technology has been rapidly adopted as the key enabler for self-driving cars. Kyle Vogt, CEO of GM Cruise, says, “sensors are a critical enabler for deploying self-driving cars at scale, and LIDARs are currently the bottleneck.” Rapid innovation to make lidar sensors faster, smaller, and cheaper with higher density, higher accuracy data make adoption near inevitable.\n\nWhat does the data look like? Rather than a 2D image displayed on a flat screen, a lidar sensor generates a 3D snapshot of the surrounding environment. It scans the area with pinpricks of light, measuring the time-of-flight of reflections, and thus precisely capturing a collection of (X, Y, Z) points. We can reconstruct this to display on our screens, much like an Xbox game.\n\nThe richness and fidelity of this type of data feeds a new generation of AI algorithms (e.g., see this paper about deep neural nets with direct voxel inputs by Apple), making depth perception much easier.\n\nMUCH MORE THAN SELF-DRIVING CARS\n\nIt's not just self-driving cars. 3D point clouds power a variety of machine vision use cases.\n\nWhile an autonomous vehicle may use a technique like SLAM to dynamically build a 3D map of the environment, providers of high fidelity mapping data collect their own point clouds so that they can provide the ground-truth reference map. For example, providers like HERE could build 3D into their HD Localization maps.\n\nDelivery robots are another exciting use case for lidar sensor based perception. The navigation concepts are very similar to automotive, but many delivery robots can more easily traverse sidewalks and coexist with pedestrians.\n\nIn a warehouse context, robots with 3D lidar sensing are able to shift materials around, rapidly picking up and transporting pallets to reconfigure the warehouse or optimize manufacturing workflows. Collision avoidance in the presence of human operators as well as indoor navigation and mapping round out the common ways that 3D point cloud data power cognitive robots.\n\nFinally, unmanned aerial vehicles -- otherwise known as drones -- can use lidar to collect high resolution 3D data, such as when \"corridor mapping\" a pipeline, surveying a construction site, or performing visual structural inspections.\n\nEmpowering the Human Element\n\nSama has extensive project experience annotating lidar sensor data from cutting-edge instruments. While we quickly ramped projects to produce those annotations on our clients’ own in-house apps, we wanted to create a tool flexible enough for the broader market.\n\nThat's why we're launching our 3D annotation tool that supports a wide range of 3D data types from essentially all lidar sensors. We have likely worked with sensor data from your lidar vendor of choice.\n\nThere's more to it beyond the raw data.\n\nThe Sama mission is to use human ingenuity to accelerate AI development, and one of our favorite tricks is to use algorithms to assist and interact with our expert human annotators. Our new 3D tool has some powerful time-saving features such as:\n\nautomatic cuboid estimation to quickly capture an entire object after clicking only a single point;\n\nautomatic ground-plan extraction to make objects and environs easier to discriminate;\n\nsynchronized camera images for 2D confirmation of the 3D points; and\n\nobject tracking estimation to accelerate annotation and predict movement even when objects are occluded or only partially visible\n\nThis approach lets us combine the skills of expert annotators, who can cleverly correlate what a camera shows with even sparse point clouds, with algorithms to accelerate the manipulation of 3D annotations in space and time. Together, we rapidly produce ground-truth annotations of the highest quality to power 3D perception.\n\nThe bottom line: our clients get to market faster with their latest 3D perception algorithms. Quality and throughput make a difference.\n\nExperience Matters\n\nWe have run many projects through our teams, and consistently produce the quality results made possible only by long-term, dedicated annotation experts. The Sama model allows our agents to concentrate on a single client's data, understanding the nuances and unique requirements of their machine learning team (e.g., how precisely to enclose an object, whether to include side-view mirrors or bicycle racks, how to treat objects that pass out of view, what constitutes sufficient visual contact, and so on).\n\nOne project included side-mounted lidar sensors that produced data rotated by 90 degrees. Rather than expecting our team to annotate with their necks tilted at an angle, our engineering team whipped up a quick \"rotate camera\" tool to quickly reorient the workspace. Between continuous improvements of our Hub annotation studio, iterative refinement of the project objectives and annotation goals, and experience with point cloud data from nearly every lidar sensor out there, there's a bright future in 3D annotation here at Sama.\n\nPartnering with Sama, you can get the most from your 3D lidar projects. We’re incredibly excited about this production-ready 3D annotation tool and the future of high-performance lidar.

Unfortunately, many of those articles target expert audiences who already know how to code and design algorithms. What is machine learning, anyway, and where can you turn to get up to speed on the basics?\n\nIn this post, we’ll present a simple overview of machine learning and how it helps computers solve complex problems. Even if you're a complete novice, you'll learn something new from the information below.\n\n\nWhat is Machine Learning?\n\nInsider blog TechEmergence compiled a definition of machine learning that aggregates definitions from several leading experts in industry and academia:\n\n“Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.” - TechEmergence\n\nThe key difference between machine learning and traditional programming is that a machine learning algorithm does not have to be told formally how to get from the input data to the output data. The machine learning algorithm is given examples of input and the expected output and it learns the rules itself. As the algorithm is presented with more input examples and their associated expected output, it can improve decision making performance over time.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you played chess against software that was built using machine learning, the software powering your computer opponent would study the results of your moves, its moves and its strategies to become a better player. Eventually, it would learn so much that it would defeat you in every game - even when presented with unfamiliar scenarios it had not seen and analyzed. Even if you're a chess master, the computer will almost certainly learn to play better than you.\n\nYou can apply the chess example to any type of information. For instance, machine learning could help software identify people trespassing on property, predict stock market trends, navigate autonomous vehicles, identify farming pests and more. As long as the software has access to useful data and a reliable algorithm, it can learn.\n\n\n\nThe Three Types of Machine Learning\n\nNot surprisingly, a cutting-edge computer science topic like machine learning can get very complicated. Most machine learning work can be grouped into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\n\nSUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nSupervised learning means that software is trained on data that has been labeled. For instance, you might input a 500 images labeled \"cow\" and another 500 images labeled \"human” into the algorithm. After analyzing the images, the program could differentiate between a picture of a human or a cow based on an analysis of the pixels arrangement color and shape. Reasonably accurate computer vision programs require large quantities training images and can make amusing mistakes if inadvertently trained to notice something else -- like grass. \n\n\n\nLabeling data makes it considerably easier for computers to learn. This principle isn't surprising when you think about how you learn. Imagine if someone handed you a page full of numbers with no explanation. You probably wouldn't know what the numbers mean and thus you wouldn’t know how to process that data right away. However, if you were then handed the same page of data with the label “phone numbers,” the numbers suddenly make more sense.\n\nUNSUPERVISED LEARNING\n\nIn unsupervised machine learning, the data used do not have any labels. Without labels, successful machine learning usually requires more data before it can generate useful outputs. The algorithm can try to detect similarities and differences in the input data and start to group them based on those characteristics. With enough examples, the groupings can become very meaningful.\n\nReferring to the scenario above, the phone numbers (assuming they have area codes) would have three digits that vary far less than the following seven. The unsupervised learning algorithm could start to group the phone numbers based on their similar area codes, and correctly assign a newly discovered phone number into the appropriate area code group.\n\nOf course, the algorithm doesn’t even know what an area code is, but it has learned something important about patterns that it can apply to sorting future samples. (And now you perhaps have an inkling of how Netflix can recommend movies based on your previous viewing choices.)\n\nREINFORCEMENT LEARNING\n\nReinforced learning conceptually splits the difference between supervised and unsupervised approaches with a trial-and-error approach. In the chess-playing example, you might have an algorithm that can make any move, and a grader that tells the algorithm whether the player’s move is legal (that is, if it tries to move a pawn six spaces forward, the grader says, “nope!”). Through trial-and-error, the algorithm would eventually learn how each chess piece should move. Similarly, as it plays through more games, it would learn what it means to win or lose, and how to better achieve the wins.\n\nIn fact, just these kinds of techniques allowed the AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero programs to very rapidly become world-class Go players.\n\n\nClean Data is Necessary (But Hard to Get)\n\n\nMachine learning relies on clean data. Without reliable data, software can't learn the right lessons or become better at usefully automating tasks. It might learn from the noise instead of the signal.\n\nUnfortunately, it's difficult for data scientists to provide the most advanced learning algorithms with good, clean data. Some of the reasons include:\n\nInsufficient people to label a mountain of raw data;\n\nIrrelevant data that gets mixed in with desired data;\n\nIncomplete or partially labeled data; and\n\nHuman error in labeling data\n\nThese challenges could mean that your machine learning algorithm uses corrupted training data, which could lead to poor learning results that get repeated and amplified. The software, in other words, doesn't learn the right lessons to do its job well.\n\nWorking with a partner that understands the most effective ways to source and identify clean data will give you an advantage over competitors.

While we do assist in data collection, most of the time clients come to us with data in need of enhancement, annotation, and more.\n\nWhere does the data come from? Well, data collection varies widely, so in this post we’ll look into the most common questions around this topic.\n\nData collection is a systematic strategy for gathering and measuring information from a variety of sources to get an accurate picture about a specific area of interest. The collection of various data points allows your company to answer specific questions, evaluate potential outcomes, and make predictions about future possibilities and trends.\n\nData is powerful. However, it’s not only about having the data, but also about knowing how to capture the right information — and then understanding how to use it effectively.\n\nA decision based on data rather than intuition brings success rates up by as much as 79 percent. But what is data collection, what can you do with it, and what is the potential impact to your business?\n\n\nData Collection: Understanding Why It Matters\n\nSuccessful businesses have always relied on some type of data. Yet the difference between businesses of the past and those of today is that the sheer volume of data available has rapidly expanded. Having more data empowers these leaders to tap into insights that were difficult to harness in the past.\n\nBut why is data collection so important? Here are a few of the major reasons.\n\nData is the backbone of solid decisions. Data arms you with the details required to make results-driven decisions. For example, let’s say that you need to restock inventory. One approach is to restock based on general insights and anecdotal details from sales staff. An even better strategy, however, is to tap into the data, gather insights and truly understand what is in short supply and any future trends that may make an impact.\n\nData assists with solving complex challenges. For example, let’s say that you’re planning an upcoming sales promotion and want to feature a specific product. An educated guess will tell you which product might be a good fit for a specific market segment, but data provides an even better option, one that is more accurate. Using analytics, you could view previous purchasing patterns and determine that preferences are leaning toward an entirely different product; performing this analysis saves you time and money.\n\nData assists with improving processes. Perhaps you want to understand why one department performs better than another. Data can help you dig deeper to get a more accurate picture of what’s going on with each department and the factors at play, and then come up with an effective solution so that other departments perform just as well.\n\n\nWhat Type of Data is Most Important to Collect?\n\nWhen you're trying to understand data collection, it helps to better define the pieces of information that must be gathered. The problem isn’t having enough data; there are vast amounts of data for your company to collect, harvest and use to gain valuable insights to run a more profitable business. So the question is actually what type of data do you want?\n\nFor example, let’s say that you own a retail store and you want to better understand how customers are moving through the store. Viewing the paths that customers take to purchase various products would allow you to more accurately anticipate customers’ needs and place the correct merchandising along those paths. Some companies even leverage data collected via GPS through apps in which customers consent to the collection, and the data is available to learn more about customers’ behaviors and preferences.\n\nOr maybe you want to learn more about online shopping patterns for specific segments. For example, how many products and what types of products do customers look at prior to their final purchases? If so, you might collect data points along the buying journey to glean relevant insights and ultimately improve the customer experience.\n\nUltimately, the first step in deciding what data to collect is determining what you want to learn. Because there is a vast amount of data to collect, you must know which “bread crumbs” to follow; otherwise, you’ll be lost.\n\n\nWhat are the Potential Benefits of Effective Data Collection?\n\nThe results of collecting, analyzing and gaining insights from big data are significant. For companies that use big data, 92 percent of executives report being satisfied with the results and 89 percent rate big data as very or extremely important. In fact, 89 percent of those surveyed in a report conducted by General Electric said that lack of big data adoption creates risk of losing market share.\n\nThe effects of accurately collecting the right data apply to a variety of business areas, such as customer service, which has the potential to create much stronger bonds between the company and the customer. For example, Delta Airlines uses big data to tackle one of the biggest fears of travelers: lost baggage.\n\nThe company checks over 130 million bags each year, and it also became the first airline that allowed customers to track luggage via their mobile devices. The tracking application has been downloaded over 11 million times and uses data to help customers relieve the anxiety that comes with the worry of losing important baggage.\n\nThis is just one example of the positive impact that data collection can have, but there are many more, all of which have the potential to create changes in a business that make customers feel truly known and improve your bottom line. In many cases, the data is already there, so all you must do is seek it out, glean insights from it, and start reaping the rewards.\n\nIf your company needs help with data collection, Sama is here for you.\n\nOur services help our many clients achieve their business goals while also changing the lives of our workers, who earn a living wage and lift themselves out of poverty.\n\nContact Sama today to learn more about our data services.","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"what-is-data-collection-and-why-do-you-care"},"tags":[{"_key":"E5C8tuMS","label":"Training Data","value":"Training Data"},{"_key":"nEjDa8yW","label":"Data Quality","value":"Data Quality"}],"title":"What is Data Collection and Why Do You Care?"},{"_createdAt":"2018-01-24T20:52:26Z","author":{"_id":"cc6094b6-cdfd-4509-b972-c1539888dcdf","avatar":{"_type":"image","asset":{"_ref":"image-e0fe681e594567792ac79048513fe955cc770f54-518x518-svg","_type":"reference"}},"bio":"Currently a Senior Account Executive at Sama, Marcelo works with enterprise clients in the high-tech space to help develop their AI strategies and get the most out of their training data.
