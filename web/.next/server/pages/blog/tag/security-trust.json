While the initial public perception of AI was “will automation steal my job”, steady progress has seen facets of AI and Machine Learning technology present in our living rooms, cars, phones and more, mostly without people knowing. That said, an important question has emerged: What level of trust can—and should—we place in these AI systems?\n\nIn an age of increasingly complex governmental data privacy requirements, it can be hard to understand not only the level of personal data that’s available, but also how this is protected, both in law (GDPR, Information Privacy law etc.), but also through the development of solution provider products.\n\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) is to be considered any information which could identify a specific individual. Of course, the wide definition of PII can create challenges, especially when searching for AI training data as it can cover anything from IP addresses, imagery, behavioral data, social media information, and more.\n\nWhy do we need such swathes of data? Well, a simple input/output equation suggests that more data equates to the ability for increased training and training environments. This, in turn, leads to models that are often increasingly accurate due to both the level of training and the various training scenarios it has been placed inside [1]. At this stage, it is also important to recognize the differentiation between both structured & unstructured data as well as supervised & unsupervised learning. You can read more on this here.\n\nTo surmise, the main challenges faced by those in need of large data training sets include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nInability to utilize all owned data due to GDPR and CCPA privacy restrictions\n\nLack of anonymized video training data available for use\n\nPreviously used techniques, including pixelation of imagery reducing model performance for video analysis\n\nRequired manual human intervention\n\nRecent developments on our platform aim to address the above through the use of Vector Annotation, Semantic Segmentation, Lidar/3D Annotation, and Dynamic Labelling. These developments when coupled with ISO-certified data centers, vulnerability testing of systems, data storage encryption & GDPR compliance, not only ensure the highest level of internal security, but also the most dynamic and innovative data utilization service available.\n\nMany applications have previously struggled to keep personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources, especially when street-level images, cars, retail places, and similar are discussed, however, Sama uses deep learning pre-annotation technology to anonymize data without the need for a human intervention! The process for this includes:\n\nData is run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs\n\nThis service automatically detects faces and license plates to obscure and does so until unrecognizable\n\nThis AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm\n\nThe above, through the lack of human intervention further accentuates the privacy of PII data\n\nThis service then allows for increased test data at a faster pace, without compromising security, allowing you to scale your AI whilst also not compromising the trust of stakeholders\n\nWant to learn more?

This technology enables obscuring of sensitive, personally identifying information (PII) in training data.\n\nIn light of new laws like GDPR and CCPA, it’s important for companies building AI and ML technologies to carefully manage data with PII information. Obscuring PII helps Sama and our customers work to protect privacy.\n\nSama’s PII Data Anonymizer helps make more data available to train AI by keeping personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources: People in camera images from retail spaces and public places, street-level images of people and license plates captured by vehicles, smart city applications on public transit and more.\n\nApplications for anonymization range from autonomous transportation, detailed customer demographics, customer data like clothing and emotion, people counters, and security.\n\nThis deep learning pre-annotation technology allows Sama to obscure faces and vehicle license plates that appear in data without the need for any human intervention. That means that private information remains private and is never seen by another person.\n\n\n\nWhen Sama receives customer data, it can be run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs. The service would automatically detect faces and license plates and obscure them, as well as blur faces and license plates so they are not recognizable.\n\nAlternatively, it can replace faces and license plates with realistic computer-generated avatars. This AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm.\n\nUnlike manual blurring, Sama’s PII Data Anonymizer is run without a human examining the data, which contributes to the privacy of PII data. It is built on deep learning and is run within our technology platform, ensuring that customer data never leaves Sama’s secure cloud environment.\n\nFrom pilots to multi-year projects, Sama securely trains and validates computer vision and NLP models. We work on a range of use cases ranging from e-commerce to autonomous transportation, manufacturing, navigation, retail, AR/VR, and biotech.
