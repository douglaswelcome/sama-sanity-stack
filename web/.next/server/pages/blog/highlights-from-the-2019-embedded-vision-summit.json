Take a look at my related blog post for more details. \n\nAI at the Edge\n\nOn the exhibition floor, the hottest topic was AI at the edge and edge computing. AI at the edge brings AI into small, powerful computer chips located directly in devices, such as phones.\n\nWith the computing happening in the device itself, AI devices no longer need to send data back to the cloud. AI at the edge enables remote and distributed applications, such as using a cell phone to diagnose crop diseases on rural farms.\n\nFor Sama, AI at the edge means new, flexible applications for computer vision that might require new training data strategies and solutions.\n\nHigh quality training data annotation continues to be a high priority need for companies developing AI and computer vision. The challenge remains: high quality data at a reasonable cost and timeline.\n\nBlending highly trained workforces with annotation automation and auto-labeling can make significant gains in efficiency. Sama’s expert, experienced workforce combined with our technology continues to be an offering that is well-positioned to help address these problems with real-world data.\n\nPHOTO: Computer vision in action on the showcase floor recognizes Audrey's face\n\nData Capture\n\nAt the Sama booth, we had many great conversations about data capture. Attendees who stopped by our booth also asked questions about semantic segmentation and smarter video interpolation.\n\nThough computer vision has advanced in many ways, data capture remains a challenge - particularly as algorithms become more sophisticated and require bespoke data sourcing.\n\nThat’s one of the many reasons why Sama plans to expand our data capture offering.\n\n\n\nPHOTO: Wendy Gonzales (left), Audrey Boguchwal and Heather Gadonniew at the Sama booth\n\nData Bias\n\nTowards the end of the two-day event, I presented on training data strategy in the Technical Insights II Track.\n\nIn my presentation, I discussed approaches to training data strategy for avoiding data bias and considering legal and ethical sourcing issues. Data can be biased if it does not represent reality accurately: it is missing examples of use cases, or doesn’t have enough examples of use cases (even if a few are present).\n\nBiased data can result in poor algorithm performance if an algorithm simply doesn’t work as designed. Even worse, biased data can cause problems if say, a facial recognition algorithm identifies the wrong person as a criminal, or an autonomous vehicle algorithm fails to detect the presence of a cyclist.\n\nI also discussed legal and ethical sourcing considerations: knowing regional laws and considering privacy and other gray areas when sourcing data. We’ll update this blog post to link to the video of my presentation when EBS posts it. Also be sure to check out my related blog post for more details.\n\nPHOTO: Audrey mid-sentence while presenting on training data strategy\n\n2019 Women in Vision Reception\n\nWe were invited to attend the first Women in Vision Reception ever held at EBS. It was inspiring to hear the exciting work in which other women are involved.
