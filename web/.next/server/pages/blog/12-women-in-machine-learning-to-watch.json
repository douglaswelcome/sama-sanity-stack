Maybe not unexpected for those witnessing it up close, but a whopping growth trajectory nonetheless. While machine learning models strive to mirror and predict real life as closely as possible, the people behind these models don't represent the real world. Despite this rapid forecasted growth, women still only make up a 12% of the ML workforce.\n\nAt Sama we believe in inclusive AI that benefits everyone, and believe highlighting role models is a key part in this work. With that in mind, we put together a celebratory list of some of the women we look up to and have spearheaded development in AI and Machine Learning in 2020. While it was near impossible to narrow down our list, we highly encourage you to connect with them and follow their incredible work going into 2021.\n\n\n\nFeryal Behbahani, Research Scientist, DeepMind\n\nFeryal obtained her BEng from Heron-Watt University in 2006, later going on to receive her MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Doctor of Philosophy in Machine Learning from Imperial College London.
