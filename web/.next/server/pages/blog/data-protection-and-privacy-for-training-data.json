These developments when coupled with ISO-certified data centers, vulnerability testing of systems, data storage encryption & GDPR compliance, not only ensure the highest level of internal security, but also the most dynamic and innovative data utilization service available.\n\nMany applications have previously struggled to keep personally identifying information safe across a variety of data sources, especially when street-level images, cars, retail places, and similar are discussed, however, Sama uses deep learning pre-annotation technology to anonymize data without the need for a human intervention! The process for this includes:\n\nData is run through our anonymizer technology service before any labeling occurs\n\nThis service automatically detects faces and license plates to obscure and does so until unrecognizable\n\nThis AI-generated content creates training data that looks like real-time data when people and vehicles are the primary objects of interest for the algorithm\n\nThe above, through the lack of human intervention further accentuates the privacy of PII data\n\nThis service then allows for increased test data at a faster pace, without compromising security, allowing you to scale your AI whilst also not compromising the trust of stakeholders\n\nWant to learn more?
