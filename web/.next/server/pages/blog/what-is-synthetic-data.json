Synthetic data is system-generated data that mimics real data in terms of essential parameters set by the user.

Synthetic data sets have a wide variety of applications such as image processing, IoT, AI, machine learning, defense, and natural language processing.

Synthetic data is typically created via a generative model from the original dataset that produces synthetic copies which closely resemble the authentic data.
