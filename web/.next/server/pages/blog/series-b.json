Since Day 1, we’ve been committed to building technology that has a positive impact — across industries, but also across the globe.\n\nThis is no small task, and we’ve been busy since announcing our Series A funding in 2019. \n\nWe have opened offices in Kampala, Uganda, and Montreal, and Samasource became Sama. We were honored to win the 2020 AI Breakthrough Award for Best Image Processing Solution and this year were included in lists such as Forbes AI 50, Inc. 5000 Fastest-Growing Private Companies, 2021 AITechAward in Machine Learning Platforms category, and Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas.\n\n\n\n\nSama became one of the first AI companies to receive B Corp Certification and was recognized on the Best for the World™ 2021 list for BLabs Workers category.

Enterprise AI teams have adopted a growing number of niche tools to support their end-to-end AI development cycle, and a lot of time (and accuracy) is lost building the infrastructure and pipeline required to integrate it all.\n\nAt Sama, we believe there’s an opportunity to bridge this gap, and to do so responsibly.\n\nToday, I’m thrilled to share that we’ve raised $70M of Series B funding to build the first end-to-end AI platform that enables teams to manage the complete AI lifecycle from start to finish.
